description: machine learning week 6 - SVMs and email spam classifiers

this "week" was disappointingly easy. basically implement some supplied formula (gaussian kernel) and then run it a bunch of times. i think thats kind of the point of SVMs but what i really need is a comparison chart of logistic regression vs svm vs nn's.
