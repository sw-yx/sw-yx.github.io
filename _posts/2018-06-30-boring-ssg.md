more notes on boring ssg

- so i am taking fixtures/ssr as my reference and making a [boring-SSG](https://github.com/sw-yx/boring-SSG)
- babel-register shoudl work but doesnt, i dont know what i am doing wrong. [filed a bug](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/8241) but dont have high hopes
- just adding an extra "env" preset fixed it i think. i was going to try [this starter file method](https://timonweb.com/posts/how-to-enable-es6-imports-in-nodejs/) next. [filed a followup comment](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/8241)
- **ok so i can output HTML! woo!** ðŸŽ‰
- the hydrate doesnt work because i need to send it along as javascript separate from the HTML.
- now adding parcel to the bundle to make the js bundle
- had an [issue with class properties](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/issues/867) definitely doesnt make me feel great about parcel yet. but it bundles!
- the problem is parcel bundles to specific hashed chunks which i cant predeict when i send it out. so i need to somehow inject the chunk name into my html render
- async/await to the rescue. im just popping off the name of the first childBundle which is the js but i know that is going to be volatile. we'll see how to fix that
- ok i got the js loading to work from html but now parcel's assumptions are coming to bite me: "Uncaught TypeError: Super expression must either be null or a function, not undefined"
- that seems to be a bug in parcel :(  changing the Chrome class to a function fixes it
- aafter a bit more tweaking I HAVE A REHYDRATING APP!! WOO!!
