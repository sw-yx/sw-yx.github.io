time to code the bum rush logic.

a ship takes 5 turns to undock and 5 to dock.
it takes 3 ships 4 turns to produce a new ship.

So total if you were born at just the right spot you could make a new ship in 14 turns. The real number is probably 16 or 17 since ships are never born next to a planet.

So if I can get to you in 17 turns i should bum rush you.

Since bum rushes work as well with 2 ships as with 3 i might as well only send 2 ships.

ok lets try that.

nothing i try works. sad.

i made some progress with bumrush by being sensible with it. its 5am and im not getting anything else done.

on to the rambo

So there are a few characteristics of a Rambo unit that I want:

- attacks furthest enemy docked ships
- persistent
