my other commitments continue to drain my coding time. I have 15 minutes so I am just going to hit up codewars again.

Katas done:

- convert number to binary: use toString(2)
- duplicateEncode exercise: match indexOf with lastIndexOf, and join after splitting
- tribonacci sequence: use slice(0,n) to return all up to n. or use slice(-3) to cut the last 3.
