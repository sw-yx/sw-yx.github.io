After about a week of stressing and research I have just submitted all the necessary files for Sacha's SED interview! The experience wasn't 100% smooth but it was positive and I am keen to do more to ask the questions I want to ask from people I really respect.

What did not go well:
- Zencastr failed on me, I had no opportunity to test it just before and there was no real fix as far as I could determine
- I did not properly introduce or ask introductory questions when changing subjects and tackling what I knew to be a very complex topic (VulcanJS), which caused Sacha to have to do it for me.
- I did not feel like I asked very good questions in following up on the State of Javascript survey and here i was a victim of the scope. I was hoping for "deep insights" on trends and I didn't get any of that.
- I dont feel like I ended it well, was kind of a "wham bam thank you ma'am" and I didn't like that. I know Sacha feels he could have introduced VulcanJS better and that was my job to help him.
- Didn't get any magic pill when it comes to improving design, which I guess is tough if it doesn't exist.

What went well:
- We got some real numbers out about surveying developers, which I think is a very hard task
- We talked about difficult topics especially MDG's evolution and also (after some difficulty) into why VulcanJS is useful
- Sacha plugged a bootcamp which I had no idea about and I really liked the idea while he explained it.
- It didn't sound terrible!!!!

All in all a decent first attempt and I hope to get better.
