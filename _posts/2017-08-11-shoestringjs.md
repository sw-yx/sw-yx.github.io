today we did <https://github.com/sw-yx/fsa-shoestring.js> and it made me have some appreciation for the behind the scenes working of Bootstrap. also was a re-introduction to SCSS but i am still not very comfortable with it.

We ended the day with flexbox and looking at retrospective. i enjoyed playing @csallen's <flexboxdefense.com> and going thru the wes bos <flexbox.io> tutorial and took some notes [here](https://gist.github.com/sw-yx/cdd85db3e92f070d5ba164cf05cfd428)
