as expected work and family bit hard today. it will bite even harder tomorrow. When I am short on time I am just going to fire up my [List of Newbie Resources](http://swyx.io/blog/2017/01/16/List-of-Newbie-Web-Developer-Resources) and just do something off the list.

Today I did a couple exercises on codewars.com. There is a decent FCC contingent here.

the exercises so far reveal that i use answer accumulators too much. I need to use functions that I KNOW how to use but just dont have the habit of using, like array.reduce(prev,current,index,array). There are some strange formats i dont quite understand myself with x.push().
