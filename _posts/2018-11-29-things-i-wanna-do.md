as a frontend guy i am pulled in two directions for growth right now. on the very front end there is better design: https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1068003187867607040

i love sarah's course and i want to practice it every day.

i also got framer recently and want to get good at it: https://framer.com/learn/resources/

but then i also have the backend stuff i want to get good at, which seems to be mainly serverless:

- https://github.com/serverless/examples/tree/master/aws-node-twitter-joke-bot
- https://serverless.com/blog/no-server-november-challenge/
- https://github.com/DavidWells/buslify

if i am to focus i need to pick, or just have consummating projects that go back and forth. the STAR project idea i am thinking about may be a good avenue to practice this.
