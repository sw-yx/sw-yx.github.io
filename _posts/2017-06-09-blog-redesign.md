I finally decided to give enough of a crap about this blog to give it a facelift.

When I first set up this blog I had enough issues with applying default github pages themes that I pretty much gave up and let it look like crap.

So I tried <http://hexo.io> on the recommendation of [Evan You](evanyou.me). But unfortunately the only theme I liked was by [Josh Gerdes](https://github.com/joshgerdes/joshgerdes.github.io) and required installing [Nokogiri](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1504) which has well known compatibility issues with OS X and the ruby versions I tried did not work.

I flirted with going back to Jekyll for my blog hosting but eventually broke through on the hexo to github deployment. and now you have a nice site.

Thank god for open source!
