finishing fullstack today was bittersweet and I will attempt to write a broader review this weekend. I did a lot of podcasting and it went well.

Today I am thinking the most about what happens after. When you could do **everything**, then making the decision to do **anything** becomes that much harder.

Let's think in terms of time allocation.

I also want to frame things in terms of "what is lasting truth". I don't have a lot of time which raises the stakes.

I am still keen on fast.ai and exploring django. I don't know that it is important at all to what I will do but it could be. This gets 10%.

I do want to build microsaas projects. This gets 50%.

I do want to do algorithms and apps. This gets 20%.

I do want to continue content creation and curation. This gets 20%.
