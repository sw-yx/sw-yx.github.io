Babel <3 GraphQL

Babel plugins can help solve DX and UX tradeoffs by metaprogramming to write code the way that is best for you while delivering code that is best for the user. Case in point: JSX - but why stop there? In this talk we explore how babel-blade solves the double declaration problem in all React GraphQL client libraries, and  how to get started writing your first babel plugin!

Shawn is an Infinite Builder and DX Engineer at Netlify. He enjoys helping the community online at /r/reactjs and getting first-timers started doing their first talks in the New York tech scene!
