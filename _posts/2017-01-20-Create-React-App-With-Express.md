i nearly missed my session today and i am so traumatized from the last Crawler session i am taking a break from that today. instead today I aim for a relatively easier thing to do: implement <https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app> and [deploy to heroku](https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack).

---

well that was easy. <https://sentieoapp1.herokuapp.com/> is live.

now to put in a few customizations... 

this is the guide to adding express routing to react: <https://medium.com/@patriciolpezjuri/using-create-react-app-with-react-router-express-js-8fa658bf892d#.y77yjte2j>

as expected, i ran into problems deploying this thing to heroku. I posted it to SO and hope to get good feedback. Expreience has been very positive so far.  i can prototype stuff in codepen here <http://codepen.io/swyx/pen/MJpLpr>

I have managed to get it running on github pages but again i run into trouble where it comes to subdomains.
