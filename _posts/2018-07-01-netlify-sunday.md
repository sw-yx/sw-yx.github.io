second wind

- i have a couple of paths i can pursue now. i dont like the separate declaration of paths. but i also probably want to have a data injection model, and thats probably the meatier thing to tackle rather than nitpicking about dev ergonomics.
- create-jamstack-app could be interesting - netlifycms is really good to show off the power.
- ok well lets do this i guess

misc thoughts

- "more projects than people" is a great comment
- "answer a different question" when facing a tough/boring question
