Triage

- 
- future <https://github.com/facebook/react/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Type%3A+Big+Picture%22> (old [react-future](https://github.com/reactjs/react-future) repo, [core team](https://github.com/reactjs/core-notes) notes)


this could be you

- <https://twitter.com/acdlite/status/769272685209669632>
- react has 1.8m downloads a month, 80k github stars, only 1,100 contributors. 1% of React developers?
