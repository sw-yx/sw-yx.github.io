Our two main instructors so far have been [Cassio](https://twitter.com/cassiozen) and [Dan](https://twitter.com/danceoval?lang=en)

We have also seen [Omri](https://github.com/omriBernstein) and [Kate](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kateehumphrey/).

today we replicated a bit of jquery and we called it selector.js. it was interesting to dig into actual dom manipulation as i hadn't done that before but it was also not very hard.
