big day today. i am typing this from my new apartment in long island city where i have just moved in with Arun. 

September is a new chapter in many other respects for me too. We will formally end junior phase at fullstack tomorrow although I basically finished it when i did my senior project. I have started learning react native and i hope i will get my stuff done in time to submit it.
