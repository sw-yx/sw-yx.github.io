So I have been taking a bit of a meteor detour but the more I read the more I like it (particularly because of [meteor toys](meteor.toys) but also just avoiding mucking around with sockets and databases and getting optimistic rendering for free.

I am going to get [Base](https://themeteorchef.com/blog/introducing-base-v4-0-0) which is a React+Meteor boilerplate ([Github here](https://github.com/themeteorchef/base) ). and then stop messing about and start tweaking it to work through the gameplan for the book trading club. here goes.
