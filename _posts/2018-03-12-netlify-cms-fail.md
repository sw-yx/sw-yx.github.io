i tried adding <https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/add-to-your-site/> to my personal site today. it failed. first i tried adding just `admin/index.html` and `config.yml`. this deployed but i wasnt able to navigate to `/admin` on the deployed site. so i suspected it was reactrouter/gatsby fouling it up. so referring to `gatsby-starter-netlify-cms` i thought i needed `gatsby-plugin-netlify-cms`. however that brought a bunhc of baggage i didnt need.

i will have to come back again to retry.
