i saw some pluralsight courses today by cory house. he has a bunch of good ones

- setting up a dev environment
- big picture of react (very short, just a biased pros vs cons list of react)

i also tried getting a little bit into typescript but was incomplete.

i tried to revamp the dev blog today but the gatsby template i picked was not good. struggled.

---

i was really really really inspired by vincent woo on IH today <https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/041-vincent-woo-of-coderpad> i think my takeaway is just be good at coding and just keep making.
