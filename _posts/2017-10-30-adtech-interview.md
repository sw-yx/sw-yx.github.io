couple interviews today

theres a real market demand for react vs vue. its just so sad but i am not fighting the market.

today i worked on some interesting problems:

- make a performant frontend pub/sub/unsub module: this was the hardest, and i didnt quite get the data structure right of how to set up an event database
- send data to an API endpoint WITHOUT fetch or XMLHTTPrequest, queued: done through an <img> tag, queued with addEventListener
- higher order function wrapper to handle and memoize errors of a generic function: testing spread operators and function.apply

reactnyc was meh but seeing noopkat live was cool and also Harry Wolff from mdb.

i am humming along on autopilot and i dislike that
