first real code review and i picked up some tricks

- use setState's callback form to do synchronous setState
- javascript engineers who do typescript often dont make their own classes but they should! this is an upgrade of just making an interface or types! <https://github.com/MykolaGolubyev/react-typescript-samples/blob/master/ui/src/examples/tasks/Tasks.ts>
