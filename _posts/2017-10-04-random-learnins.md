today I learned a few bits and pieces, none with much connection but all sorta kinda interesting.

1. i noticed that you can selectively require parts of a module in nodejs, e.g. [with Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup) you can `require("firebase/app")`. this is the major hurdle i have been facing with creating a clientside `swyx` module (that really isnt that major but bear with me)

2. watched a great @sxywu talk on [react and d3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w493jXg5D8o&feature=youtu.be)

3. solved a gnarly performance problem with [easystarjs](https://github.com/prettymuchbryce/easystarjs) in phaser
