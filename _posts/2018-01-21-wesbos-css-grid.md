description: thoughts on taking wes bos' css grid course
---

i completed viewing cssgrid.io in 2 days. grid is receiving a lot of attention recently and the [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid) is all green for major browsers.

grid has very nice features in particular

- grid gap
- grid template areas
- minmax spacing
- spans
- negative number reference
- auto flow support (probably a bad idea to use this though)

and the media query reshuffling is as wonderful as promised.

but it cannot handle

- variable length items
- scrubbers

i also loved the fact that wesbos took the chance to show off

- css variables
- css animation
- linear-gradient
- pseudoselectors (nth child, before, after)
- order -1 media query
- html5 tags like figcaption
