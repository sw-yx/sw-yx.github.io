i rode my voting app high from yesterday until very late last night and now after catching up on some long overdue todos i am back in code mode. the task of the next 3 days will be to crash course React as quickly as possible which will be tough because i am working off of a video based udemy course. I still have Meteor, Ruby/Rails, and Angular to check out. just to do a survey of these technologies is so incredibly draining while i am going through it but I'm sure this is just a blip in the grand scheme of things.

Off to React.
