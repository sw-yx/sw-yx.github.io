This October is Hacktober, a month of OSS contribution. today i went to the ReactNYC open source meetup and worked for a couple of hours on the Firefox debugger, in particular this performance issue: <https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/issues/4236>

I guess I kind of got lucky as I picked a very unpopular topic (performance) and I was the only contributor in my group. I was mentored by Rob and also Ilya which made for a 2:1 mentor:mentee ratio! I enjoyed learning about grepping for files when vscode fails you, console.time and console.profile also working cross browser.

I made minor tweaks to my `swyx` module.
