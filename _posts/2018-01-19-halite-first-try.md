description: taking a crack at halite ai
---

i was thrown off course by an email reminding me that halite is ending in a week so i am putting some time into halite.

resources:

- <https://pythonprogramming.net/custom-ai-halite-ii-artificial-intelligence-competition/?completed=/modify-starter-bot-halite-ii-artificial-intelligence-competition/>

my bash script needed some modification to get it to work:
```bash
./halite -d "240 160" "python3 MyBot.py" "python3 MyBot_v0.py"
```

this is run_game.bat which is then run with `bash run_game.bat` in the terminal.

i was able to get the basic bot up and running and am now working on an attack strategy.
