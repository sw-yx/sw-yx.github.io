woot woot lets go

2.7 Task analysis

- PROCESSOR: GOMS model
  - strengths
    - formalizing user interaction
  - weakness:
    - doesnt address complexity like alternatives and parallels
    - assumes user is expert
- 5 tips:
  - focus on small goals - eg navigate to end of doc
  - nest goals instead of operators - smaller goals. operators are smallest atoms
  - differentiate descriptive and prescriptive
  - assign costs to operators (usually time)
  - use goms to trim waste
- PREDICTOR: Cognitive Task Analysis
  - emphasis on memory and cog load
  - specifically what you can't see
  - collecting preliminary knowledge
  - identifying knowledge representations
  - apply focused knowledge elicitation methods
  - analyze and verify data acquired
  - format results for intended application
- PARTICIPANT?: Hierarchical Task analysis
  - large tasks are very composed of smaller tasks
  - break out checkout process from purchasing process
  - strenght: emphasize mental processes
  - strength: 
  - weakness: de emphasizing context
  - weakness: time intensive
  - weakness: ill suited for novices

2.8 Distributed Cognition

- how a cockpit remembers its speed
- four models of context! :)
  - distrib cognition: models of cognition outside the mind
  - social cognition: friend driving with you. jira. but be careful of letting them knwo everything
  - situated action: filming with daughter. task is what we do, not what we design. task grows out of the interface, not independently. memory is very context dependent as well.
  - activity theory: predates HCI.
    - why is user doing the task in the first place. not just -what- they are doing.
    - users can move up and down the hierarchy of activity -> action -> operator.  the more competent you are - driving a car - the more of a subconscious operator it is

## 3.5: prototyping

- verbal prototypes
- paper prototypes
- wiz of oz
- wireframing
- physical prototypes

5 tips:

- keep prototypes easy to change
- make clear that its a prototype
- be creative
- evaluate risks
- prototype for feedback

## 3.6: evaluation

- three types of eval: qual, empirical, predictive
- eval terminology:
  - reliability - whether assessment is consistent over time
  - validity - whether it actually affects reality
  - generalizability - whether results can be extended
  - precision - level of detail 
- what to eval
  - efficiency - how long to accomplish?
  - accuracy - how many errors user commits?
  - learnability - how long does it take user to hit level of expertise?
  - memorability - does user rememberthe ui?
  - satisfaction - careful of social desirability bias
- 5 tips: qual eval
  - run pilot studies to iron out the kinks
  - focus on feedback - dont spend too much time teaching one user
  - use questions when users get stuck
  - tell users what to do not how to do it
  - capture satisfaction - just ask if they even like it
- 5 tips: empirical eval - categorical, interval, nominal, etc. see table.
  - control what you can, document what you cant
  - limit your variables
  - work backwards - decide what qtn you want to answer, then decide what you need to find out
  - script your analysis in advance, dont torture data
  - pay attn to power - size of effect inversely related to size of survey
- predictive eval
  - heuristic eval (take the 15 things)
  - model based eval eg goms
  - siulation based evaluation

3.7 - agile and HCI

- you want agile when: 
  - low criticality
  - frequent requirements change
  - small teams
  - team embraces change
- framework for agile and user centered design: http://www.ime.usp.br/~marivb/ihc3.pdf
  - the differences are:
    - imptnce of documentation
    - amount of research before getting it out to user
  - high user involvement
  - close team collab
- live prototyping: oxymoron? optimizely. esp useful for ecom where costs are temporary but benefits can be permanent
- a/b testing with real users
- 5 tips:
  - start more traditional, then shift to agile once up and running
  - focus on small changes
  - adopt a parallel track method. have hci one sprint ahead of dev.
  - be careful with consistency. dont mess with expectations of frequent users
  - nest your design cycles - keep learnings from small cycles to big cycles
