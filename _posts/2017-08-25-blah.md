today is one of those days i just didn't feel that great about anything. i got done early and ran in central park, had dinner with DSP friends, had drinks with Chan and Colin from the flex cohort. on the surface its an active social life. but none of it means anything.

i also helped out a fellow from the coding blocks JS channel <https://github.com/aflansburg/ebay-node/pull/1> and did a lunchtime session for jannine and jordan.

on the surface all good little things.

but i am so. tired. of being insignificant.
