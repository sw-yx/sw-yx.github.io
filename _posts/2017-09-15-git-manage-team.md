today the team was significantly happier than we had been all week. I think its a combination of being near the end as well as not doing any testing related stuff since the backend was all done. we also decided to split four ways and develop pages independently which caused an interesting git merge scenario at the end of day but nothing too bad. this was my first experience kinda managing a team of developers and getting them to develop significant features to the best of their ability and coordinating on stuff where they overlapped.

I also did a couple more podcast interviews with Sam and Emily and they went extremely well. I am excited to see what the end product might look like when I finish the whole series in a few months.
