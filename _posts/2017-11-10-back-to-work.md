very ho hum day at PDT

i am being tugged in several directions right now and am not really accomplishing much with my core goals. I need to commit and focus and stop getting distracted.

That said signing up for FEM has been a great experience so far and there is lots of learning to do.

i started work on a small react duotone component after seeing some inspiration from [creative tim](https://www.indiehackers.com/@alexpaduraru/60f6221d67). <https://sw-yx.github.io/react-styled-duotone/demo/>
