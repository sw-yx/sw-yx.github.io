i tried using <https://github.com/HippoAR/react-native-arkit> today but got frustrated by the xcode link.

first off, the automated linking didnt work because it has a "Library not found for -IRCTARKit" error.

then the manual adding also doesnt work because xcode crashes: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45345066/xcode-crashes-whenever-i-add-files-to-the-project>

frustrating. i filed an issue but have no expectation of resolving. <https://github.com/HippoAR/react-native-arkit/issues/25>
