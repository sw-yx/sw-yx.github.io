11.30. Entering a 3 day low productivity period due to family commitments. I need stuff that I can do with just 1-2 hours a day. That said I think I am in a moderately productive zone right now and can crank out more of the nightlife project. stay tuned.

3.30 here. Made solid progress by getting the core search functionality up and running on heroku: <https://quiet-mesa-37696.herokuapp.com/>. So the only things that remain are to hook it in to a user model with the database and then sprucing up the UI (because the other guys' UI's are putting mine to shame.) I would love to bang this out over the weekend but unfortunately work and familiy commitments will mean I need to put all this on hold for now.

- interesting that [`material-ui`](http://www.material-ui.com/#/components/text-field) is more starred on github than `react-bootstrap`
