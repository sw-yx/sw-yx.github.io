i start at netlify tomorrow! i had a great call with david wells today and i am still a little in disbelief that i was offered this great job. i really dont want to screw this up.

i took a little detour reading about operating systems and have more content to add. i redid my presentation from beautiful.ai to slides.com and have more freedom around it - in particular, being able to build my diagrams in the app is important.

i renamed creat to reactive-react. i am pretty much dropping the alternate universe thing - i think it is too ambitious for my first ever talk. 

i last left it in the middle of a refactor to stateMap. i need to finish it so that every component has local state based on the component instance. then i need to work on demos.

statemap worked well

i tried to do the timeslicing thing but that was a bit of a fail because victory requires react. and i dont really feel like doing a bunch of react-reactive-react compat work OR working in D3.
