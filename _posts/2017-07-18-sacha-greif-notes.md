6:40 - Do you know the problem they are trying to solve with Meteor, since you are intone with this community?

no competition on the API middle layer - thats why focus on Apollo. replace rest? jury is out.

9:28 - So let talk about the State of JS Survey, what bring the idea about and did you get all this stuff going, and how did if become such a popular thing?

JS fatigue - are things getting more complex or structured?. 9000 respondents on HN/jsweekly/retweet. didnt want to bias results for meteor.

13:10 - What was the biggest thing that you were not expecting to see with the resonse?

JS developers are actually happy - stockholm syndrome? need webpack etc to "just work"

17:15 - What is your opinion of those who are complaining of the many open source project, that are similar to one another?

complaint is fragments open source ecosystem - sacha dont buy that. survival of the fittest. changing api complaint. dont need to be on the latest stuff - slack runs on php.

25:00 - What did you see in the survey, that did not surprise you?

react. react native. 20 percent had used it. demographics vs privacy balance is a problem.

mobx - nobody heard of it.

surprisingly high on firebase. vs netflix fileco.

meteor is a pleasure to work with when it comes to authentication

35:00 - Have you guy went over the CSS results? Those are kind of interesting to me? Can you talk about what CSS is about? Is their something out there that allows you to do those kinds of things with Java Script?

Less/SCSS?

CSS fatigue - CSS modules, CSS in JS.

Styled components - mxstbr - hover/nested

37:35 - Speaking of CSS, I don't know if you want me to talk about how I built the survey?

gatsby - static site generator based on react (like jekyll). started by using hexo between react and static site but hard to context switch so went with gatsby. comparbale to phenomic but havent used phenomic. gatsby is like CRA as it generates all your stuff. also does SSR. can parse csv json or yaml https://www.peterp.me/ is on gatsby

41:00 - So what were the main takeaways for the survey?

bestofjs.org - vue. "needs more mature way of doing complex things" - need best practices.

vue native

44:00 - How hard was it to build the actual survey website? Did that take a lot of time?

3 weeks. getting people to contribute writeups took longest. need experts. Spent a day or 2 on label collision algos.

46:00 - So how are you monetizing from the State of JS?

wes bos or egghead.

47:56 - Where are you going next?

js learn list

49:oo - Can you give some advice on full time freelancing/consulting? How do you get you clients and do your marketing?

stay frugal and put money away - quit day job and keep company as client.
