long day today and so basically nothing done on the dev side. I am doing one thing which is following up on [yesterday's SO question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41533177/how-can-i-tell-when-this-setstate-exists-in-es6).

so it looks like I basically just need to be more careful on the distinction between passing references and passing functions. functions are not first class citizens in js and therefore when i call `this` from within a passed function it returns `undefined` which was the source of my immense confusion. 

taking a look at the next task, it seems that i will have to get data (through jquery or other means), line up data from two separate datasets, and then render in a reasonably static page. not the tallest order but there are key elements i will have to learn tomorrow.
