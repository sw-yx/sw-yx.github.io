I am about 40% done with the sr. enrichment project. today i set up the backend and testing and wired up a [basic frontend from Creative Tim](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/material-kit).

I had the most trouble with css as I wanted to use cards which i didnt know were not part of bootstrap 3 which creative tim is based on. i had hoped to use Zurb but it looks like they really emphasize the expensive training.

i need to add robust adding/editing interfaces which in theory is easy but i am dicking around with minor css things over functionality and tomorrow i will need to lean more heavily in that direciton.
