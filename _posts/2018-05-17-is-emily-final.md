Notes from Emily

Episode 5: 
- 6 mins in: picking GHA because they were worried about being too intense
- all female - safe space for IS
- impostor syndrome
- i feel it more outside of academic environment
- overcoming IS is about having more data points
- graphs, data structures, binary search
- dog park app

Episode 16:
- Junior phase was intense!
- The pace of the course was so fast - no time to follow up and easy to slip
- If everything matters, then nothing matters.
- What does matter is the big picture and the process: getting better at concepts and debugging and designing, and not getting lost in the fine grained details.
- Enjoyed: messing around with React Native
- Dog Park app - maps, navigation
- apprenticeship program at microsoft
- tensorflow tech talk: senior yr bioinformatics in college
- senior phase expects: not as stressful, just get an MVP
- design is fiddly, you can do it while watching NCIS
- time commitment: work life balance is always defined
- professional ambitions: 
- more than anything else: GHA taught her there's so much else to learn
- don't want to be part of a club that would have me as a member
- #1 priority is to work with smart people
- #2 reasonable work life balance
- rover
- how does she feel about bootcamp: hesitant about bootcamp - if you feel ready, go for it (esp tuition forward)
- as happy as she has been for years
- reacto - realistic?
- necessary but not sufficient

Episode 28:
- Firebase vs SQL? firebase
- using redux to control the game flow vs the reactive paradigm
- game loop algorithm piece
- design aspect - nightmare?
- demo - sound crowd, hard to judge what's easy and difficult
- career prep: definitive answers
- focus on networking
- systems and not goals: have a system for job search process
- reacto too easy
- overlapping rectangles
- google doc: list of things for emily to learn (mvc, ror/django/ aws, os stuff)
- bootcamp advice? just do it
- how much more can we do if we worked like this 13 week phase
