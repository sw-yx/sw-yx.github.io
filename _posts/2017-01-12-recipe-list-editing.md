checking in at end of session here. I was not very productive today with multiple distractions on podcasts and slack. I got quite far with regards integrating accordion and modal elements from bootstrap which look and feel great. I even implemented adding and deleting of the recipes which was a great thing in React. However I fell over pretty hard when trying to refactor my adding function to also do editing. I think it was a little ambitious but it is the right thing to do based on the DRY principle.

I should get this done tomorrow but it has taken me longer than it should and I'm not proud of it.


got this link <https://nodeschool.io/> off coding blocks and this is a good roadmap to follow. there is already a long list i will have to compile at some point.
