title: ripping off design
---

i am gleefully ripping off design from [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-html-elements/lessons/intro-to-html/exercises/body-html?action=lesson_resume&course_redirect=learn-html) with a few tools:

- [SnappySnippet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/snappysnippet/blfngdefapoapkcdibbdkigpeaffgcil)
- [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)

i am also going to use react accordions instead of what i would normally do which is resort to bootstrap+jquery.

- [accessible accordion](https://springload.github.io/react-accessible-accordion/) looks too primitive in design
- [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components.html#panels) looks okay
- [react responsive accordion](https://github.com/glennflanagan/react-responsive-accordion)
- [sanfona](https://github.com/daviferreira/react-sanfona) <-- using this one because cat gif

react resizable panels
- <https://github.com/tomkp/react-split-pane> great demos but seems heavy?
- <https://zesik.com/react-splitter-layout/#/standard-horizontal>  small and lite! sold!
- <https://github.com/adaptiveconsulting/react-flex-layout> takes idea from react-split-pane
