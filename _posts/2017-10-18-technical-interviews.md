---

today I completed my capstone!! <https://github.com/sw-yx/FSA-GraphQL-of-Thrones> and <https://graphql-of-thrones.herokuapp.com>

I also surveyed my classmates and the results are here: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bhDd3ZtqwCrPG5hsVcjOdhJ7lyT4sJZHiyKkwnbbUMg/edit#gid=0>. Of note:

- about half of people considering learning a new language picked Python, with C++/C# 2nd and Go 3rd
- AWS was the top technology to learn with other popular techs pretty much in a dead heat. this was a surprise and highlights people know how impt cloud is
- leetcode and CTCI were top picks for interview prep.

items:

- algos eg implement mergesort
- concepts eg what is closure
- code analysis eg what does this code print
- project code spelunking eg tell me about this function you wrote for your project
- coding challenge eg build an app that allows users to create and share quizzes
- logic/reasoning eg how many golf balls fit in a bus
- architecture eg design battleship

algos
- reacto

concept
- trivia
- but focus on what you do know
- use examples and metaphors
- goal: show depth, passion, communication skills

code analysis
- reasoning >> truth
- your job involves looking at code you didnt write

spelunking
- validate your contribution
- get a sense of project planning
- tangible sense of you as a programmer
- your past doesnt define your present

coding challenge
- mid interview
- takehome project
- free work/spelunking/meeting deadlines
- tests
- time maagement can be tough

logic/reasoning
- no need for domain knowledge

architecture
- high level planning - mentioning tools, libraries, entity relationship diagrams (ERDs), UX flows
- how data flows in application
- difference between programmer and software engineer
