today i worked on <https://github.com/cleverbeagle/research/issues/12> and i think the main next thing to worry about is the email sending process so i should work on that.
theres a lot of interest in vue and graphql so we might have to check that out next but i want to get my thing to launch.

i also did a little bit more marketing of the sunburstjs project and my next convo with john will be tonight.
