title: machine learning week 5 and 6
description: halfway through the andrew ng coursera course
---

last two days i did weeks 5 and 6. week 5 was rough as it was the "toughest assignment in the course" and i was coming off of a long break so i had to get in the mental shape agian. week 6 was a drop off in intensity and it iwll probably get easier from here. i already know PCA.

i started looking into what i really want to learn which is reinforcement learning. this was supposed to help me with halite.

however i realized that none of my material covers this. it is just too new.


here is a Deep Reinforcement Learning bootcamp with a lot of useful talks <https://sites.google.com/view/deep-rl-bootcamp/lectures>

[OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) seems like the useful library and here is Andrej Karpathy's pong walkthru <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqrcjHuNdmQ>

Andrej also has a JS library that could be just what i need for a basic game: <http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/reinforcejs/puckworld.html>
