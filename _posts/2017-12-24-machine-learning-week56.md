title: machine learning week 5 and 6
description: halfway through the andrew ng coursera course
---

last two days i did weeks 5 and 6. week 5 was rough as it was the "toughest assignment in the course" and i was coming off of a long break so i had to get in the mental shape agian. week 6 was a drop off in intensity and it iwll probably get easier from here. i already know PCA.

i started looking into what i really want to learn which is reinforcement learning. this was supposed to help me with halite.

however i realized that none of my material covers this. it is just too new.
