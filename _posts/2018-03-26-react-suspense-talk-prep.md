just planning out my talk for react suspense. the format:

https://twitter.com/swyx/status/961082736252420096

1. Start with Why (Have a Goal)
2. Make Them Laugh (Entertain)
3. Show some facts (establish credibility, relevance)
4. Poll the Audience
5. Answer the poll (more facts)
6. Show what they can do ( ðŸ’° shot )
7. Reach the Goal
8. Leave breadcrumbs

Basic flow

- Why We Dont Want to Think About Rendering
  - It is a profoundly erroneous truism, repeated by all copy-books and by eminent people when they are making speeches, that we should cultivate the habit of thinking of what we are doing. The precise opposite is the case. 
  - Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them. 
  - Operations of thought are like cavalry charges in a battle â€” they are strictly limited in number, they require fresh horses, and must only be made at decisive moments.
- Think Less
- Whats the Laugh???
- Facts
  - Build a webapp with Vanilla JS
  - Build the same thing with React
  - React Family Feud - what do we like about React
- We dont have to think about the Render
