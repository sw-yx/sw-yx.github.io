since rewriting my blog in gatsby and then rewriting again in sapper, i have been very inactive here as i've tended to manage my life on the DX github project, and also just living day to day on fighting the next battle.

life in NJ has been very nice although solitary and i need to make it more my own.

things to do today:

- check in on my omscentral project
- check my own email esp jhooks stuff
- plan recordings for fcc
- read and deal with my mail
