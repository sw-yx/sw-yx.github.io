idea 21: darwin information typing: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_Information_Typing_Architecture
Wikipedia
Darwin Information Typing Architecture
The Darwin Information Typing Architecture or Document Information Typing Architecture (DITA) is an XML data model for authoring and publishing. It is an open standard that is defined and maintained by the OASIS DITA Technical Committee.
The name derives from the following components:
Darwin: it uses the principles of specialization and inheritance, which is in some ways analogous to the naturalist Charles Darwin's concept of evolutionary adaptation,
Information typing, which means each topic has a defined primary objective (procedure, glossary entry, troubleshooting information) and structure,
Architecture: DITA is an extensible set of structures.

And actually, making this a publicly accessible graphql server would be pretty hot. Then all the js desktop tools coming out could very easily query the same API for their integration

idea 42: “gatsbypress idea”: `templates` to be a magic folder, break up gatsby-node.js’ `createPages` into individual templates. this is far too common a pattern not to be part of the platform

swyx [10:32 AM]
it should not be possible for templates to “bump” into each other

in particular try to prevent lazy filtering like this: if (!_.includes(slug, `/blog/`)) {
