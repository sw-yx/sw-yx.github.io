today I presented [CrossBones](https://github.com/sw-yx/crossbones) (see github repo for stackathon video). it was the result of 2 failed mobile app attempts and a last ditch sprint from 10pm - 4am the night bfore the stackathon was due. i got the "fullstackian" award for it but perhaps i'm more proud that i had a hand in two of the other wins, one for design (thanks [Creative Tim](http://creative-tim.com)) and the other for voice UI <https://www.talater.com/annyang/>. I also intereviewed David, who won the fourth award for "Mad Science".

The rest of the afternoon we had the day off and I ended the evening acapella free for the first time in a year and spent it at the Bell House. 

all alone, of course.
