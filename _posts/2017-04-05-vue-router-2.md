finishing up the udemy vue router tutorial. transitions are intuitive and guards are handy. lazy loading utilizes the es6 resolve function:

```
const User = resolve => {
  require.ensure(['./comopnents/user/User.vue'], () => {
    resolve(require('./components/user/Users.vue'));
  });
};
```

which creates an asynchronus function .


i viewed the stuff for vuex but i am not likely to need it anytime soon.
