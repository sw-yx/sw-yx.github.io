some notes on followup call

- have potential - good at coding portion
- concerns around "problem solving", breaking down the process before starting on the problem
- come back next year
- usually see much better performance
- knowing hash table and graph problems - need to get there quicker on just a small prompt
- simon wasn't the issue - it was probably the snow question
- want more experience
