9.00 here. i have fleshed out the prototype table but have realized that I really want the left frozen panel and so I am going to migrate the table to a google chart table <https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/table>

I am going to add in the interactive elements now.

11.00 here. i reconstructed the vladimir project and hosted it on github since I accidentally corrupted my last version with the nightlife app. <https://github.com/sw-yx/vladimirponomarev-clean>. dont feel very productive so I am just going to take a break for now.
