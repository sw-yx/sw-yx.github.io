i have nothing positive further to say about fullstack so this is the last of it you will hear

i went to vuejs meetup today. saw evan you in person and he was as impressive as expected. [Justin Bennet](https://twitter.com/Zephraph/status/913196850206961665) gave the best talk of the night. Very exciting stuff and motivates me to learn grapql more (as well as webpack and vue internals).

but i am also very drained from the day job.
