description: trying to set up a parceljs + node + express+ react + apollo + graphql boilerplate and failing
---

today i tried hard to set up a parceljs fullstack boilerplate with apollo but failed: <https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/issues/2785> probably wasted 5 hours on this thing.

it will be fixed but wasnt too happy about the documentation.

back to machine learning.
