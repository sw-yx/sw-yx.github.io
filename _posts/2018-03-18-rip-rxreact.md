description: putting my reactive react idea to death
---

i am officially killing my rxreact attempt.

- twitter thread: <https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=swyx%20react%20rxjs&src=typd>
- rx wants to be pull based, rxjs wants to be push based <https://reactjs.org/docs/design-principles.html#scheduling>

i also walked thru the didact tutorial - <https://github.com/sw-yx/trydidact> and got it working.
