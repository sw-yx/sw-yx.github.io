description: taking down my poorly phrased post.
---


i made a poorly phrased tweet yesterday in the depths of my babel exploration

this got way more traction than i thought (which was zero, id ont really think about these things).

sashko called me out on it: <https://twitter.com/stubailo/status/1014899241905295360> and ultimately despite my desire for the message to get to people i agree it was poorly phrased. so i took it down.

i think people care about what i might have to say now. i worked hard for that. and i need to be responsible for the platform i am trying to grow.
