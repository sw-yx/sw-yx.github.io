## Day 2

---

## Andrew Clark

- Performance is integral to UX
- There is nothing inherently wrong with spinners - on slow networks they show valuable visual feedback
  - but if shown unnecessarily, they degrade the UX
- *playing count the placeholders*
- Concurrent React
  - renamed from async to emphasize what makes it special
  - work on multiple tasks at a time and switch between them based on priority
  - partially render a tree without commiting the result
  - does not block the main thread (today react is synchronous)
  - designed to solve real-world problems commonly faced by UI developers
  - works with hooks and class components!
- Demo
  - code splitting with `lazy()`
  - avoiding spinners with **Suspense**
  - Data fetching with **React Cache**
  - prerendering **offscreen content**
- In Suspense, if React starts rendering an async component that isn't ready yet, it has to render a fallback. The error message is something like `Error: An update was suspended, but no placeholder UI was provided`.
- In Sync mode - lazy loading is possible with `.lazy` but it still shows the flash of spinner
- In ConcurrentMode - no spinner, no flash
- On a slow network - you need to configure the exact threshold you are willing to wait for before you fallback to a spinner (see Jared's talk) or else it will delay
- new thing `import {scheduleCallback as defer} from 'scheduler'`
- tell React which update to wait longer for
- now: coordinating spinners using suspense
  - every component currently has a case where data == null and they individually render a Spinner
  - the nice thing about suspense is that you can treat async data over a network as if it were sync data from memory
  
  ```js
   import {createResource} from 'react-cache'
   const APIResouce = createResouce(() => fetchAPI())
   
   //reading
   const read = APIResource.read('reviews/3')
  ```
  - rely on suspense for fallback
  - no local state
  - no async event handler
  - no classes
- adding `hidden={true}` prop to div - gets the super low offscreen priority prop

Concurrent React summary

- Time Slicing
  - rendering is non-blocking, yields to user input
  - coordinate multiple updates  at different priorities
  - preredner content in the background wihtout slowing down visble content on screen
- Suspense
  - access async data without blocking
  - *missed it*

Status:

- 16.6: lazy, and Suspense
- 16.7: ConcurrentMode
- ???: React Cache, Scheduler

## Profling React - Brian Vaughn

16.5 or newer - you can see profiler in DevTools

features

- record, stop
- at the top it shows each commit. size is determined by render time
- right hand panel shows info about selected commit
- main panel shows info about what the app rendered
- brighter yellow

typeahead usage demo

- Prevent unnecessary renders with `React.memo` - wrap functions in memo
- Improve slow renders with `useMemo`:

```js
// rerenders each time
const filteredUsers = filterUsers(users, searchText)

// much faster updates
const filteredUsers = useMemo(
  () => filterUsers(users, searchText),
  [users, searchText]
)
```

- label updates with new `trace` API https://fb.me/react-interaction-tracing
- new Profiler component in 'react' https://fb.me/react-profiling

## Moving to Suspense - Jared Palmer

- Incrementally moving to Suspense
- step 0: add Strictmode and address warnings (eg cWM)
- step 1: switch from `ReactDOM.render` to `ReactDOM.createRoot(domnode).render(jsx)`
- step 2: wrap app in `React.Suspense`, add fallback spinner
- step 3: swap out any code split component code with `React.lazy`
- step 4: use suspense for assets - audio, video, fonts etc. you can show a low quality image placeholder and load the high res version in the background. with suspense, you can let React figure it out.

```js
const ImageResource = unstable_createResouce(source => new Promise(resolve => {
  const img = new Image()
  img.src = source
  img.onload = resolve
}))

const Img = ({ src, alt, ...props }) => {
  ImageResource.read(src)
  return <img src={src} alt={alt} {...props} />
}

// usage

<React.Suspense fallback={<img
  className="artist-image preview"
  src={artist.images(2).url}
  alt={artist.name}
  />
  }
>
  <Img
  className="artist-image loaded"
  src={artist.images(2).url}
  alt={artist.name}
  />
</React.Suspense>
```

benefits of suspense

- feels "sync"
- easy to coordinate
- fast and pretty

## SVG illustrations as React Components - Elizabet Oliveira

@miuki_miu

Transforming SVG into JSX. Benefits:

- no HTTP requests
- code splitting
- make use of props, state, and event handlers
- disadvantage: complex to update the SVG (design)

## The Missing Abstraction of Charting - Chris Trevino

@darthtrevino

- easy to fall off the cliff of abstraction in dataviz - often use 2d APIs instead
- there is a missing abstraction between low level 2d api's and high level charting api's
- charting libraries
  - victory charts
  - react-vis
  - recharts
- common issues with these libraries
  - victory has taxonomic charts, simple components, and draw primitives
  - rechart has  taxonomical containers and limited legal children
  - react viz has shapes and components but it is the only abstraction level
  - they are coupled to a specific rendering tech
- a solution for solving the missing abstraction:
  - [the Grammar of Graphics](https://smile.amazon.com/Grammar-Graphics-Statistics-Computing/dp/0387245448?sa-no-redirect=1)
  - phases:
    - scene specification
    - assemble abstract scenegraph
    - rendering the graph
  - similar to compiler
    - program specification
    - assemble AST
    - assembly
  - implemented in python/r with ggplot and altair
  - in JS: its `Vega`: https://github.com/vega/vega
- showing sample vega code.
- showing `chart-parts` - a vega alternative with grammar built in? https://github.com/Microsoft/chart-parts
  - components: provides scales, marks, and guides
  - includes a11y!!!!!

## AI Conversational Agent Aimed at improving mental health for women - Damini Satya with Elsa

- people dont get help
- women suffer in particular
- need a friend who is a compassionate listener, gives motivation etc
- chatbots today aren't good
- elsa's goal
- elsa doesnt help with addictions, not a replacement for therapist

## Block the Main Thread - James Long

*missed this talk*

## React Native's New Architecture - Parashuram N

## Let React Speak Your Language - Tomas Erlich

- i18n (languages) vs l10n (cultural)
- having to work with translators who dont code
- example: `{formatDate(now)}`
- key is to separate runtime data from language
- normally it uses ICU (International Components for Unicode) MessageFormat
  - `today is {now, date}`: date is a parser
  - formatting options: `percent` option
  - pluralization: `{count, plural, one {#book} other {# books}`
- this actually looks a lot like jsx!
  - variables
  - formatting
  - built-in
  - richtext
- use a babel macro to do this
  - transform jsx into icu message format
  - `@lingui/macro` -> `@lingui/react`
- create a RUNTIME catalog
- the biggest problem of i18n in browser: bundle size overhead
  - message parser is huge - either runtime parser or compiled messages
  - benchmark: 600msgs website, 40% size reduction seen
- future: mozilla is wokring on a new message format projectfluent.org
- Hooks: No

*out for the rest of the conference*

## Day 1

## React Today and Tomorrow: Sophie Alpert and Dan Abramov

**Note: [The Hooks RFC is live here](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/68)**

Fun intro: React is now more popular than jQuery!

What still sucks about React?

- Wrapper hell
- parallel setup/destruct in componentDidMount and componentWillUnmount
- Reusing logic
- classes are confusing (`this`)

Fundamentally: **React doesn't provide a stateful primitive simpler than a class component.**

We have a proposal:

- no breaking changes
- Proposed APIs are new
- We need your feedback

Instead of classes and constructors and binding, why not do this:

```js
import { useState } from 'react'

export default function App(props) {
  const [name, setName] = useState('Mary')
  return (
    <div>
      <input value={name} onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

useState is a hook. We'll explore more hooks now.

With hooks, state can be a string like we did above, or an object, or we can call the `useState` hook twice:


```js
import { useState } from 'react'

export default function App(props) {
  const [name, setName] = useState('Mary')
  const [surname, setSurName] = useState('Poppins')
  return (
    <div>
      <input value={name} onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)} />
      <input value={surname} onChange={e => setSurName(e.target.value)} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

ok so that's the useState hook. notice we dont use classes or `this` anymore. 

What else do we use classes for?

***useContext**


```js
import { useState, useContext } from 'react'
import { ThemeContext } from '../somewhere'

export default function App(props) {
  const [name, setName] = useState('Mary')
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext)
  return (
    <div style={theme}>
      <input value={name} onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

**Unusual Limitation**

You cannot call hooks within conditions. it has to be top level. This is an unusual limitation but it enables other things you will see.

**Replacing lifecycle methods**

To perform side effects in a class we use lifecycle methods. For example, `componentDidMount`.

If we want to do it with hooks we do `useEffect`:


```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'

export default function App(props) {
  const [name, setName] = useState('Mary')
  useEffect(() => document.title = name)
  return (
    <div style={theme}>
      <input value={name} onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

`useEffect` runs both after the initial render and subsequent update.

in classes, we divide logic based on lifecycle method names and have to keep it consistent.
in functions, effects are consistent by default.

**tear down**

in classes you can tear down whatever you set up in componentDidMount with componentWillUnmount, for example an event listener.

with hooks it is intuitive: 


```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'

export default function App(props) {
  const [width, setWidth] = useState(window.innerwidth)
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleResize = () => setWidth(window.innerWidth)
    window.addEventLIstener('resize', handleResize)
    
    // cleanup here
    return () => {
        window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize)
    }
    // cleanup above
  }
  return (
    <div>
      {width}
    </div>
  )
}
```

Effects run after every render, so this adds a lot of listeners. There is a way to optimize this which Ryan will cover later.

**One more thing... Custom Hooks!**

THIS GUY IS STEVE JOBS REINCARNATE HE EVEN SAID ONE MORE THING

Hook calls are just function calls.. so how do you reuse logic.. you extract it to a different function...


```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'

export default function App(props) {
  const width = useWindowWidth()
  return (
    <div>
      {width}
    </div>
  )
}

// extracted and reusable!
function useWindowWidth() {
  const [width, setWidth] = useState(window.innerwidth)
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleResize = () => setWidth(window.innerWidth)
    window.addEventLIstener('resize', handleResize)
    
    // cleanup here
    return () => {
        window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize)
    }
    // cleanup above
  }
}
```

custom hooks must start with "use". this is an important rule and we will lint for it.

If we wanted to we can even go further. custom hooks are js functions that can take arguments and return whatever values you want.



```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'

export default function App(props) {
  const name = useFormInput('Mary')
  const surname = useFormInput('Poppins')
  return (
    <div style={theme}>
      <input ...name />
      <input ...surname />
    </div>
  )
}

function useFormInput(initValue) {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(initValue)
  function handleChange(e) {
    setValue(e.target.value)
  }
  return {value, onChange: handleChange}
}
```

(WOW!!! wtf)

**important**: classes can work side by side with hooks although hooks represent their vision for the future of React.

So to sum up: the hooks proposal:

- use all React features without a class
- reuse stateful logic between components
- opt-in and 100% backwards compatible

Docs: https://reactjs.org/hooks

has been in production for a month, api's may change. dont rewrite your apps with it but try it out and let them know what you think.

It represents the way you move react forward. Dont do rewrites, have new patterns coexisting with old patterns so you can have gradual migration.

On a personal note: What does the atom logo have to do with React? it takes a user interface and splits it into independent units called components. but the irony is that the word atom means "indivisible", although we later discovered electrons which explain how atoms work. in the same way, doesnt feel like hooks are a new feature. They explain how a component works internally. 

**if react components are the atoms, hooks are the electrons.** They were there all along.

## 90% Cleaner React - Ryan FLorence

The problem with render props is it gives a false hierarchy. 

- render props nested inside each other can look like they have a parent child relationship but really they are siblings
- you can refactor and it goes away!

There is a second argument to `useEffect` that tells React what variables to diff. This is like componentDidUpdate

```js
useEffect(() => {
  // ...
}, [query])
```

*Refactors class code to hooks, it does look a heck of a lot cleaner.*

**building an accessible carousel with hooks**

*too much code to reproduce here*

"You actually really really love hooks, **in fact you love them unconditionally**."

*Demonstrates how to use the second argument in `useEffect` together with `setTimeout`*.

"Writing a custom hook can turn something stateful into a function call."

- showing off the `useReducer()` hook!!! https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer

```js
let [state, dispatch] = useReducer(state, action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case 'PROGRESS':
    case 'NEXT': return {
      ...state,
      isPlayer: action.type === 'PROGRESS',
    }
    defafult: return state
  }
}
```
- adding dom nodes with [useRef](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useref)
- combine with useEffect to move the focus to a dom node after render for accessibility!!

## Building Todo: the Game in a Cloud-only Environment - Christina Holland

React entirely in the Cloud - developing a react game/app just using a chromebook

> Demo: "TODO: the game"

The laptop only has a browser. it has no:

- IDE: AWS Cloud 9
- code files: Github
- packages, cli
- auth, database server: Firebase
- deploy/dev server: now.sh

this is great because you can still work on stuff even if your machine breaks. no "works on my machine" problem.

reasons you might not choose to do cloud-only dev:

- IP/legal concerns
- internet reliability
- pickiness about editors

> next demo: Enemies list game

showing how to set up a Firebase/Firestore app, including writing security rules

*thought: conf wifi is very important when demoing a cloud-only dev environment...*

## The Path to a Declaratively Animated Future - Matt Perry aka Popmotion

popmotion vs pose

- imperative vs declarative
- functional vs serialized
- animation-focused vs state-focused

This talk has 3 segments:

- The issues with imperative animation
- a declarative opinionated solution
- ideas for the future

Digression on imperative vs declarative: its a spectrum more than binary choice. how vs what, prescriptive vs descriptive.

## The issues with imperative animation

manually constructing transition property, wiring up event listeners, need to interleave animation stuff and scatter around the component.

## A declarative opinionated solution: Pose

CSS - is nicely declarative but there are a ton of animation features that it doesnt support eg spring physics

Pose is his attempt at making declarative animation: what if CSS was written with animation in mind first rather than layout or styling

Opinions imposed:

1. independent/individual transforms - translations first, then coordinate system. Need 
2. *i missed it*

## Ideas for the future

Conclusions: 

- Imperative api's are powerful but brittle
- common patterns are an opportunity to simplify things from Imperative -> Declarative -> Opinionated
- Simplifying animation is necessary to keep the web relevant

    - `npx create-react-app my-app --typescript`
    - rename app.jsx to app.tsx and install `typescript`
- Bryce @brkalow - Components as Units of work
  - components have lots of responsibilities - rendering, behavior, styles, side effects, etc
  - you can use a `<Refresh />` component to just refresh a page. similar to react-router's Redirect
  - Embrace using components beyond presentation
- Marcos Martins @m_u_martins - 5 animations you should know
  - hover (using pose) - example on slide
  - sticky animation (use styled-components and `position: sticky`)
  - skeleton loading
  - popup/modals?
  - *didnt catch the last one*
- shared components - *i had to miss this talk too*
- Leta Keane - better living through git hooks
  - hooks can: run your tests, standardize commit messages, lint your code, clean up your workflow, etc
  - commit lifecycle:
    - pre-commit
    - automated commit msg
    - prepare-commit-msg
    - commit msg made
    - commit-msg
    - post-commit
  - *does a demo- see her slides for hook examples*

## GraphQL without GraphQL - Conor Hastings @stillconor

When you want expressiveness of GraphQL queries without a GraphQL backend.

Graphql Design principles

- hierarchy
- product centric
- strong typing
- client specified queries
- introspective

you dont need to have ALL the problems that graphql solves to want to use graphql

solution: **RouteQL** uses tools from graphql-js and ideas from Apollo to make a system that can talk to any backend.

Launching: https://github.com/conorhastings/routeql

Under the hood:

- uses fetchDedupe to follow a lot of the logic that apollo does to resolve cache queries

Prior art

- "GraphQL Anywhere" - by the apollo team
- Apollo Link Rest

Whats supported?

- Querying
- Mutating
- Polling for data
- Caching of query data (similar options to apollo)

What's coming?

- making requests from nested selection sets
- moving arguments to more inline with typical queries
- provide automated migration path to apollo
- deferred queries at the top level
- optimistic updates for mutations
- direct access to the cache

## Playing with Polyhedra - Nat Alison

polyhedra are awesome

first attempt: d3 + bootstrap + x3dom

second attempt: went better, can render any 3d model

attempt 2.5: made a periodic table of polyhedra

making transform transitions from polyhedra

attempt 3: making transform transitions from for all her polyhedra 

- drawing lines between related polyhedra
- transform function to take the table layout and output all the animations
- tried using react-motion - was hard because it was very imperative
- others? anime? gsap? velocity?

making it mobile

- people wont try it out unless you make it mobile usable
- made icons in svg in react
- got rid of horizontal scroll

See: https://polyhedra.tessera.li/
