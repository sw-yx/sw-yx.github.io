i spent some time today researching the Lazy Prices business idea <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1658471>

my old acquaintance michelle also has related comments <http://www.aaii.com/journal/article/using-sec-filings-to-identify-risk-factors.touch>

quantlayer started and failed last year because it was selling to developers of sec api based products. a bank shot but nice try. <https://medium.com/@QuantLayer/introducing-a-modern-api-to-access-sec-filings-86edf7306be4>

secapi is still the well <http://developer.edgar-online.com/docs> <https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/currentevents.htm>

and bill mcdonald is potentially helpful <http://sraf.nd.edu/textual-analysis/resources/> but outdated.
