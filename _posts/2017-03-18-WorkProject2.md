So now I am waiting to start doing the nonprofit work for freecodecamp. in the meantime I have plenty other projects I need to take care of.

Boilerplates:

- <https://github.com/sw-yx/vladimirponomarev-clean> (authentication, server)
- <https://github.com/fullstackreact/food-lookup-demo> (bare minimum, no authentication)
- <https://github.com/sw-yx/create-react-router-app>
- <https://github.com/sw-yx/base-fcc> (meteor + react + authentication)

Work project 2:

I have started on work project 2 and the main technical challenge of uploading the data to mongodb has been completed. Now I actually have to make the interface of the damn thing. I have a lot of things I can steal from Work Project 1 but I have entirely run out of motivation today.
