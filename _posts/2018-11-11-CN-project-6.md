description: a frustrating but still somewhat cool project SDN
---

we are coding our own SDN with pyretic today but the syntax is weird. it took me like 3 hours to figure out how to run the stuff and i only just figured out that in order to skip a rule i had to pass `match()`. not `identity` or `drop` or `undefined` lol. sigh.
