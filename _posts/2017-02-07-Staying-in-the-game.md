When I go through the suck I have to remind myself what my true north is and what matters (skills, creative capacity) and what doesn't matter (distractions, money) and just steer myself back to where I was.

I last left my freecodecamp pursuits in an incomplete state: <http://swyx.io/blog/2017/01/31/Finishing-FCC-Nightlife> where I could do auth, I could do search, but I had not yet implemented the UI for adding and deleting selected bars. this is the last and trickiest part. 

I tried putting the selected bars data (multiple checked table rows) within the same component as the search, but that seems to be two way data flow and fairly hard to implement in react. I am going to back off this idea and go back to a vanilla selection of ideas.
