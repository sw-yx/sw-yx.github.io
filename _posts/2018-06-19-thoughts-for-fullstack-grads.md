[some facts](https://static.spacecrafted.com/b13328575ece40d8853472b9e0cf2047/r/a245d7876c624d4f9987cb4bd4f3f6e6/1/Fullstack%20Academy%20(New%20York).pdf) :

- 45% of FSA grads are employed in 90 days
- 70% of FSA grads in 180 days
- median salary $80k
- top 16% >$100k
- top 4% >$120k

note: money is not a good sole metric of outcome.

i am no authority nor a paragon of success but i find myself thinking a lot about how people should position themselves to do well during a career transition into tech. I thought I should write these thoughts down in the hopes of better structuring them for an alumni panel tomorrow. None of these things are at all required if you want to have an average life in tech, but I think each of these things help improve your odds of being in the top quintile of outcomes.

1. Learn in public
2. Open Source is an audition, not a contribution
3. Pick up what others put down
4. Clone, don't build
5. Specialize in the new
6. Use your unfair advantage
7. Engage in Dev Twitter
