description: thoughts on being a top quintile bootcamp alum

[some facts](https://static.spacecrafted.com/b13328575ece40d8853472b9e0cf2047/r/a245d7876c624d4f9987cb4bd4f3f6e6/1/Fullstack%20Academy%20(New%20York).pdf) :

- 45% of FSA grads are employed in 90 days
- 70% of FSA grads in 180 days
- median salary $80k
- top 15% >$100k
- top 5% >$120k

The difference between the 50th percentile and the 95th percentile is $40k, or 50% more pay. note: money is not a good sole metric of outcome, also 30% dont even get jobs.

i am no authority nor a paragon of success but i find myself thinking a lot about how people should position themselves to do well during a career transition into tech. I thought I should write these thoughts down in the hopes of better structuring them for an alumni panel tomorrow. None of these things are at all required if you want to have an average life in tech, but I think each of these things help improve your odds of being in the top quintile of outcomes.

# 7 rules for post bootcamp life

1. Learn in public
2. Fill in what you missed
3. Open Source is an audition, not a contribution
4. Clone, don't build
5. Specialize in the new
6. Use your unfair advantage
7. Networking in Dev Twitter

# Learn in public

If there's a golden rule, it's this one, so I put it first. All the other rules are more or less elaborations of this rule #1.

You already know that you will never be done learning. But most people "learn in private", and lurk. They consume content without creating any themselves. Again, that's fine, but we're here to talk about being in the top quintile. What you do here is to have a habit of creating learning exhaust. Write Blogs and tutorials and cheatsheets. Speak at meetups and conferences. Ask and answer things on Stackoverflow or Reddit. Make Youtube videos or Twitch streams. Whatever your thing is, make the thing you wish you had found when you were learning the thing. Don't judge your results by "claps" or upvotes - just talk to yourself from 3 months ago. I keep an almost-daily dev blog written for no one else but me.

Guess what? it's not about reaching as many people as possible with your content. If you can do that, great, remember me when you're famous. but chances are that by far the biggest beneficiary of you trying to help past you is future you. If others benefit, that's icing.

Oh you think you're done? Don't stop there. Make PR's on github. make your own libraries. Document what you did, the problems you solved. Heck, go back to your own bootcamp to tell alumni what's worked for you. There's always one level deeper.

The subheading under this rule would be: **Try your best to be right, but don't worry when you're wrong.** Repeatedly. If you feel uncomfortable, or like an impostor, good. You're pushing yourself. Don't assume you know everything, but try your best anyway, and let the internet correct you when you are inevitably wrong. Wear your noobyness on your sleeve.

At some point you'll get some support behind you. People notice genuine learners. They'll want to help you. Don't tell them, but they just became your mentors.

At some point people will start asking you for help because of all the stuff you put out. 80% of developers are "dark", they dont write or speak or participate in public tech discourse. But you do. You must be an expert, right? Don't tell them you aren't. Answer best as you can, and when you're stuck or wrong pass it up to your mentors.

Eventually you run out of mentors, and just solve things on your own. You're still putting out content though. You see how this works?

Learn in public.

p.s. Eventually, they'll want to pay you (a lot more than you think) for your help too.
