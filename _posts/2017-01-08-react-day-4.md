ok so yesterday i cheated with react by a) using codepen and b) peeking to see what the codepen implementation of react is (as it is slightly differnt from the es6 syntax taught on udemy.

today the job is:

- completely recreate the markdown previewer complete with bootstrap
- get started on the next project (fcc leaderboard on codepen)
- start migrating my snippets to [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash)

I'm at a good place and I'm optimistic I can make good progress today. 2pm. go.

not a lot done in 5 hours. i basically got stuck on the difference between es5 and es6 and got some help on SO <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41533177/how-can-i-tell-when-this-setstate-exists-in-es6/41533969#41533969>. I think this is one I have to buckle down on and learn the hard way.
