title: Principles v0
---

I honestly don't feel great about my post from yesterday. Nobody likes being told their baby is ugly but it is also not a norm to express frank thoughts on baby beauty. I won't make it a habit.

Honestly I've just had a really, really bad week. today was my 3rd or 4th day of basically not coding because I have been so emotionally drained.

in other news I got into EF yesterday and am excited about the opportunity :) I'm not quite sure how to plan for it but getting in was the main thing.

Today I had a really good chat with David Yang pretty much about everything on my mind. He was very generous with his time and helped put some things in perspective. I am looking forward to meeting with a fullstack alum he is putting me in touch with.

Lastly I have been keeping a constant mental process going this week ruminating on Principles. Ray Dalio is hitting the circuit hard with his book (now with 100% less hyena!) but it was [Ryan Glover](http://www.ryanglover.net/principles/) who really inspired me to write up my own.

So the personal mission this weekend is simple - get my personal site up to form (i have left it untouched since i joined fullstack).

Some principles I aspire to in no particular order:

- help only when asked, overhelp when asked
- Create > Curate > Consume
- What Would Alex Good Do
- Increase Alignment
- Life Is Short
- Balance [the Axis of Ego](https://medium.com/@swyx/the-axis-of-ego-58940f6673b80)
- Start With Why
- Bias toward Action

I am very excited by SpaceX's BFR Earth to Earth travel. Just a reminder that there are people working on actual hard things in the world.
