slow day today but i had some great news on the interviewing front.

i got decorator religion at today's talk at codesmith: <https://twitter.com/swyx/status/931390964194856960>

i also watched kent dodds' jest/testing Frontend masters.

i asked a fun question on HN that took off that in retrospect was a little negative in the focus. <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15718653> i think there is lots to learn about failed tech (and i do not judge). the interesting answers included:

- [itanium](https://buff.ly/2z9juNh)
- nanotubes
- CRISPR (!)
- facebook platform
- lisp
- smartwatches
- e-ink

also saw a lot of comments about google wave/glass, VR, blockchain.
