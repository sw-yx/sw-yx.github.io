i am in hardcore grind mode now for the talk. first is to flesh out reactive react.

what we need from zpao https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MAD4Oly9yg

- createElement
- Component
- render

within Component

- constructor
- render
- setState
- this.props
- this.state

right now the main task is to make didact use zen-observable so that i am reactive by default. i start off with the pure element creation bit: https://engineering.hexacta.com/didact-element-creation-and-jsx-d05171c55c56
