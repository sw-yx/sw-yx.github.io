i have been on a little bit of a broad push recently to understand what my next direction is going to be and it looks like it is metapackages. my todo list comes from /r/batmansmk: <https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/69aw8s/i_have_a_probably_dumb_idea_please_tell_me_why_it/dh6ryy2/?context=3> who also links to <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36797324/joining-development-npm-dependencies-into-single-meta-package>


he has also shared: https://github.com/tunnckoCore/charlike-cli


i am continuing work on <https://github.com/icebob/vue-express-mongo-boilerplate/issues/42#issuecomment-299636551>
