sorry for the break! i am back on the horse, writing from NOLA.

i spent today looking at react native resources. read the [official docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) and had fun trying out [snack](http://snack.expo.io).

i have been looking for a "bootstrap for react native" for a few days, and i think the best so far has been [react native elements](https://react-native-training.github.io/react-native-elements/API/forms/)
