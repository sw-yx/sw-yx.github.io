ten rules

- Get everything in writing

- Have alternatives
- Proclaim reasons for everything
- Be motivated by more than just money
- Understand what they value

- user level

dual funnel

- gh, atlassian, twilio
- self serve, or high touch
- daniel freeman, CCO
- depends on JAMstack broad outreach becoming the standard
- with developer products - you have to prove it creates a lot of value - its not just for hobbyists
