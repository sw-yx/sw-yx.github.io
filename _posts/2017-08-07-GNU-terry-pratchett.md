i think i am finally getting over my flu. worked out for the first time in weeks.

i connected with Forrest today over Terry Pratchett. it is amazing how many lives he has touched and the joy he has brought to so many. i need to book the trip. i need to be there.

i am really in a quandary adding passportjs to my project. so i am distracting myself by completing the optional FQL workshop from yesterday <https://github.com/sw-yx/FSA-functional-query-language>
