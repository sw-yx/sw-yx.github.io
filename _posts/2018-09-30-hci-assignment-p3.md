Mental model

- an internal, simulatable understanding of external reality
  - design systems that act the way the user expects them to act
  - design systems that teach the user how they react
- your goal is to teach the user how to use it WHILE they are using it
- 5 tips
  - Predictability (gray button predictable that clicking wont work)
  - Syntesizability (see the sequence of actions that led to current state - hard! eg undo history)
  - Familiarity (similarity to other interface)
  - Generalizability (similarity)
  - Consistency (similar operations should be consistent in behavior eg cut n paste)

Representations

- We get to choose how systems are visualized to users. Good relationships:
  - make relationships explicit
  - bring objects and relationships together
  - excludes extraneous details
  - expose natural constraints
- metaphors and analogies
  - use something people have already seen
  - analogies make UI more learnable, but may constrain usage to outdated concepts
- new funcitonality + old interfaces: learning curves are inevitable
  - rapid vs slow learning curves - chart analysis
- slips and mistakes
  - slips: user has right model, but does the wrong thing anyway
    - action based slips - doing the wrong thing
    - memory lapse slips - forgets to do the right thing
  - mistakes: user doesnt even know right thing to do
    - rule based mistakes: correctly assesses state of the world, makes wrong decision
    - knowledge based: incorrectly assess the state of the wrodl
    - memory lapse: forgetting to fully execute a plan, not just forgetting what to do
