today i'm going to pay a bit of my bootcamp debt by finishing the js guessing game i have been putting off.

i'm then going to see how far i can get on my bufferclone project.

guessing game was fine. the jquery tutorial they had us do was very good: <http://try.jquery.com/> but realistically i dont think i will spend that much time on jquery. <https://sw-yx.github.io/FSA-GuessingGame-Part3/> is the guessing game.
