i am dealing with severe writers block when it comes to restarting the fcc nightlife app. im not sure what this sudden lack of motivation is coming from apart from the new environment. clearly i have more to do now but i also have plenty of time to code and am not doing it at all. 

back to codewars to punch out a couple katas.
