title: landing page suck
---

the tools out there for building landing pages suck.

i did an instapage: <http://sidehustleswyxtest.pagedemo.co/> and didnt like that they dont do stripe.

then i did a leadpage: <https://sidehustlecoders.lpages.co/side-hustle-coders/> and you have to upsell to take stripe and the leadboxes point to about:blank because of a js error i am powerless to fix.
