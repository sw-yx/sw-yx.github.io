in a massive sprint to 6am last night I finished workproject 2, hosted at <http://sentieoblinkvue.firebaseapp.com>. The stack is basically firebase and vue and it is amazing how intuitive vue is. I even did my first transition work, basically bringing a form of the old html <blink> tag back.

Today I will work on the last requests in VEMB and wash my hands off that project which I have basically lost interest in.

i had a pretty unsatisfying end to my VEMB attempt today. ran into a roadblock with regards the service framework that icebob wants me to use. <https://github.com/sw-yx/vue-express-mongo-boilerplate/blob/ice-services/client/app/modules/users/store/actions.js#L64>. I can probably stick it out til this is massaged out but im at the end of my patience.
