Followup posts
- [Do you still need Redux with the new Hook APIs](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ap12uq/do_you_still_need_redux_with_the_new_hook_apis/)

user klabe2018 quotes: is there still a need for redux?

user dceddia quotes: 

Hooks makes it easier to use state in components, and group related state + side effects together. 
Hooks also make Context easier to use (with the useContext hook), and Context is what (React-)Redux uses to pass data around. 
Context is the secret sauce behind the Provider/connect components in react-redux. 
So if all you need out of Redux is the ability to pass data deeply through a component tree, Context might be good enough.

Redux brings along the debuggability with devtools, the extensibility from middleware (thunks, sagas, etc), 
and if you have complex state/business logic that you want to decouple from your components, 
Redux helps with that too. All of that could be reimplemented using hooks of course, 
but then, well... you may as well just use Redux üòÑ

User ghost20000 asks:

> I'm a new react developer, and have already worked on some personal projects with react.
> I've been pretty much avoiding function components, opting to just make component classes.
> However, with the introduction of hooks, I'm now wondering if there's any reason to use classes anymore.
> So are there any advantages to making functions instead of classes? And is there any reason to still make classes?

user SleepCircle-app says

> Short answer: use classes until you‚Äôre comfortable using hooks to replace them.

Haven't posted here in a while, figured it would be a good time after completing this series. And seems like a lot of people are starting to become interested in using Typescript with React.js

Here's what I cover:

register

handle and display errors

Hey guys! I have been working on a turn-based dungeon-crawler, written completely in React.js (& Redux). It scales for all devices and I just got it in both the app stores. Check it out and let me know what you think!

Oh and it's open-source, so you can see all the code here:

Theres also a react native version and its all open source.
