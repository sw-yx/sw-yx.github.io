how to conduct user interviews


things to test and adjust

- problem
- product
- market
- wording (use what they use)

finding people to talk to

- your current network
- become a visible expert in the space
- conferences events and meetups
- cold emails

cold emails

- short, easy to say yes
- personally connect
- follow up 3x

don't

- talk too much
- put ideas in their heads
- describe your solution
- ask what they want. people dont know what they want
- dont ask yes or no questions. 

  - "do you have that problem" vs "how does it rank among your day to day priorities". 
  - "does that sound like a good solution" vs "why might that work or not work for this business". 
  - "do you know anyone else" vs "who are 2 or 3 people i can talk to"
  
ask about

- factual questions
- past behavior
- how things operate now
- what they dont want
- what they see others doing

dig in deeper

- understand why
- tell me more

competing products

- dont despair
- ask what they like/ dont like
- what would it take for you to switch *********

near the end, ask for referrals

- warm leads respond much better than cold leads
- doesnt have to be on the call
- can ask for intro email

after the interview

- follow up
- make changes
- do more interviews until you stop learning new things (at least 10)
