description: a new dev blog theme for this site
---

after some dalliance with gatsby and netlifycms, i [ran into enough problems](https://github.com/konsumer/gatsby-starter-bootstrap-netlify/issues/2) that i simply gave up. i went on jekyllthemes and picked out this new one https://github.com/streetturtle/jekyll-clean-dark. did some [search and replace](https://lifehacker.com/5810026/quickly-find-and-replace-text-across-multiple-documents-via-the-command-line) to fit the new theme.
