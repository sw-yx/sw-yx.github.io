so i didnt get much done yesterday due to internet problems and some work distractions. that is okay. the only thing that is not ok is [having zero days](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonZeroDay/comments/1qbxvz/the_gospel_of_uryans01_helpful_advice_for_anyone/).

i had trouble deploying react to cloud9. i think it is due to my cloning an old version but the fact that it didnt work out of the box is troubling. this is my first time messing around with js preprocessing in the wild.

outside of my chosen path I have found a number of useful things today. i'm going to list them here for posterity

- [some gold advice right here from Shawn Drost, founder of hack reactor] (http://breakingintostartups.com/shawn-drost-founder-hack-reactor/). They also have a decent pre camp prep in Fulcrum <http://fulcrum.reactorcore.com/>.
- [banning the word "fine" by Mel Robbins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp7E973zozc)
- [Medium's pivot](https://blog.medium.com/renewing-mediums-focus-98f374a960be#.3w5karu9t) and [the crowing of its critics](https://www.quora.com/How-will-Ev-Williams-January-2017-Medium-announcement-affect-Quora)
- <codebyte.com> seems useful. better than <codefights.com> even though latter is winning right now.

off to class.
