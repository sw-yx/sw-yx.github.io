I am at class 27 and today's modules have been:

7. Custom queries and hooks (checking and saving unique `slug`s, compound mongoose aggregations, `Promise.all`)
8. User accounts and auth (defining a user/pw schema with passport.js, auth protecting routes, account updating, forgot password)

nonobvious things to note:
* using `this.constructor.find()` in a `schema.pre('save')` function as it is not yet instantiated
* adding custom `statics` method in a schema with `this.aggregate([{$unwind:'$tags'},{group, sort etc...}])`
* supplying the edge case of no query in a search with `{$exists: true}`
* how to make middleware to validate registration with `validator.sanitizeBody`, `checkBody`, and `normalizeEmail`'
* how to use `es6-promisify` to make User.register (from `passport-local-mongoose`) promised
* how to properly setup an `authController` Strategy for passport at the `app.js` level
* userschema virtual field and GRAVATAR GRABBING
* `crypto` module in node!!!
