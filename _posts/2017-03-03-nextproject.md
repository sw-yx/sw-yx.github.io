Deploying the vladimir project to heroku
- process.env.PORT || 3000
- either set heroku config:set MONGOLAB_URI=mongodb://abc:abc@ds111798.mlab.com:11798/heroku_p414n7r6
- or set `config/index.json` dbUri
- move all the devdependencies into dependencies

I have finished and deployed the book trading project here: https://secure-springs-51838.herokuapp.com/ with source code here: https://github.com/sw-yx/fcc-booktrading2

The trading functionality doesn't actually work but I couldn't really be bothered to get it working since I am not very inspired by this project anyway. So onward and upward.
