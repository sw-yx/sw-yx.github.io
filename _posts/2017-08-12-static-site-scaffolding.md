today was about using and customizing a bootstrap based static site: <https://github.com/sw-yx/fsa-tripplanner-static> using webpack to bundle js and preprocess sass. not the most interesting task but was a worthwhile challenge to practice.

on the design side, i watched a great video by [Morten](http://mor10.com) who made me understand [CSS grid is real](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/06/building-production-ready-css-grid-layout/) and finished the wesbos flexbox.io course and [took notes here](https://gist.github.com/sw-yx/cdd85db3e92f070d5ba164cf05cfd428)
