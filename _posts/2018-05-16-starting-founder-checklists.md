description: some initial thoughts on what i did to actually get going on my projects
---

today was a really good day. after a gym session i sat down an outlined my 3 projects:

- React Rally
- Founder Checklists
- Impostor Syndrome

and i need to just focus and get good on that. Mining instead of Collecting. Shipping instead of floating.

so today i forked my firebug netlify dsr thing and gave it a checklist thing.

RGUX did really well on product hunt and i think with a lot of work on content I can get there too. not that it is a goal. the goal is serving subscribers well and then figuring out whatever happens next.
