description: an experiment with react context
---


two new developments this week got me excited about experimenting:

- parcel is now [0 dependency for bundling react](https://medium.com/@devongovett/parcel-v1-6-0-46f4a2514668)
- ryan florence dropped his [declarative component api](https://github.com/ryanflorence/react-component-component)

and with the freakout over redux recently i got to wondering if there might be a better way to do react and redux.

steps to experiment

- have parcel 1.6 installed
- `npm init -y`
- `touch index.html index.js`
- `npm i react-dom react@16.3.0-alpha.1`
- and then do these files...
