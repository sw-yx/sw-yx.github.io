was away for 3 days for camp. it was fun and i met a lot of people. i think the level of discussion of cryptocurrency vs machine learning is markedly different. i am thinking about tech in terms of "what gives me superhuman powers" and machine learning checks the boxes. so i think this weekend i solidified the idea that i should turn the next season of IS into a learning machine learning season.
