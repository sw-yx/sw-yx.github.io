its time to go down the vim rabbit hole. i did `vimtutor` and i like `ce` a lot. also searching. it will take me a while to learn the cut and paste shortcuts.

https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/videos/onramp-to-vim-motions-and-moving

some things i like here:

- `H/M/L` for quick position jumps on a screen
- `w/b` to move fwd/back a word
- `f` for quick find.
- `;` to repeat search commands, `.` to repeat change commands
- `/foobar` to search and `n/N` to go back/forth
- `ctrl+U/D` to page up/down
- command language:
  - `ciw` to "change a word" from inside the word (prefer this over `caw` for more reusability)
  - `ci(` or `ci)` to change inside a parenthesis (or `dib` for block deletes)
  - `cit` to change inside a tag (incl jsx!)
  - `ct>` to change the params in a tag
  - `ci"` to change inside quotes
  - `dat` to delete tag and contents
  - the difference between `a` and `i` is "around" vs "inside"
  
text objects > motions

- from any location

navigating camelcasing is awkward so may want to use https://github.com/bkad/CamelCaseMotion or vim-wordmotion.

windows

- create new window: `:new`  or `:vnew` or `:split` or `:vsplit`
- `ctrl+W h/j/k/l` to navigate these windows
- `ctrl+W H/J/K/L` to move these windows
- `ctrl+W -/+/</>/=` to resize these windows
- `zz` center the line, `zt/zb` to move to top/bottom
- `:tab new` and `gt` to navigate between tabs. keep 2 at most
- `ctrl+W T` to break a window out into a tab
