ski day 3

tackling the fix of meteor's user accounts today.

6.00 checking in. i have managed to implement the user account detail editing function. I really like the Bert status update (similar to humane.js) as well as how friendly [Meteor's clientside database updating](https://guide.meteor.com/accounts.html) is. I will have a long dinner but I hope to come back to finish the MVP laid out [here](http://swyx.io/blog/2017/02/13/Cliff-of-Confusion). I need to refactor my bookList to add books separately. I think I will change the Doccuments collection to do it.
