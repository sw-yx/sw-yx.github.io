i taught a react workshop! more details here: <https://github.com/sw-yx/FSA-React-Trip-Planner> but in short i had an idea to do a peer to peer student workshop based on react as i knew it was a big pain point. suggested it, got a place and time, planned the workshop, and then did the lesson in the span of 24 hours! whoo!


now I am [le tired](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84Ud3V9NPw8) and pretty much useless to work on any projects :(
