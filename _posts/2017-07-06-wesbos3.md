i gave notice today, had an awesome interview, i did a workout today and had a guitar lesson and am now doing a wesbos class. go me!

I am at class 32 and today's modules have been:

9. Email and Permissions (email and permissions - adding owners to things and conditionally displaying based on role)
10. AJAX Rest API (ajax hardmode...)

nonobvious things to note:

* using pug to render html email
* using juice to inline css
* using htmlToText to do what it says on the tin
* setting document owners with `type: mongoose.Schema.ObjectId,` and the free lookup with `.findOne().populate('author')`
* setting text indexes and sorting `find` operations by `$meta: 'textScore'` in mongo
* sanitizing using `dompurify.sanitize`
