## The Product Review Lifecycle

But as with all product launches, the subsequent product reviews were ultimately unpredictable and wide ranging.
It will be no surprise that React fans, especially those who flew out for a conference in the middle of nowhere in Las Vegas, were receptive:
> Reusable data primitives with built-in lifecycle âœ… - [Guillermo Rauch](https://twitter.com/rauchg/status/1055600184569155585)
> React Hooks are ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥- [Kyle Mathews](https://twitter.com/kylemathews/status/1055503059474739202)
> This just blew my mind. It is the API I've always wanted. - [/u/nullified-](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/9rbsu5/rfc_react_hooks/)
And interestingly, the reception from other framework/library maintainers like [Preact](https://twitter.com/_developit/status/1055544584309223424), [Webpack](https://twitter.com/TheLarkInn/status/1055518677720690693), [Angular](https://twitter.com/Meligy/status/1056472140004831232), [Cycle](https://twitter.com/andrestaltz/status/1055529993479077890), [Vue](https://twitter.com/youyuxi/status/1056673771376050176) and [ReasonML](https://twitter.com/jaredforsyth/status/1056902656197828608) was also great.
However, it had its fair share of criticism as well, across [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18302162)
