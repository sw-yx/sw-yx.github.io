so today I am retackling the FCC nightlife app. I failed to succeed last time due to running into issues with the event recognition within the material-UI model. my options are:

- strip out material UI and use bootstrap (probably not that hard)
- switch the user interface to show checkboxes when authenticated as that is a more native interaction to the material-ui (and as a bonus I don't have to generate a different table to show the bars that the user is going to)
