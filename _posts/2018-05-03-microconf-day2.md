- make more small bets
- decide quickly on reversible things
- do things which still matter in 40 years

grinding

-  small amounts of value that create value over future and do it a lot over time

what should I build?

- wrong question
- who should i serve? who do i feel a calling to serve?

OH GOD NO

pick people
- you are energized in talking to: find the people you dont get tired of talking to
- whose problems are tractable
- with money

charitable impulses
running a healthy impulses

pieces of the puzzle figured out. the first time you walk into a bank - three squirrels in a trenchcoat. that feeling never goes away.

you're building a puzzle over time
there is no end state for your business, you are just snapping little pieces together.

it is never a bad time to talk to a customer or a prospect.
have high bandwidth conversations.

platform before product
build the things that will allow you to engage an audience and improve it over time

success path:
- 3 friendcatchers: build something that solves problems for people. they will come with their problems to you.
- 5 emails
- 45 days of grinding it out. no great brand strategy. wake up, email, twitter, blog

friendcatchers: resonant, tractable, underserved
- resonant: problem that promises to solve itself. ie not "solve global warming" but "salary negotiation for engineers" 500k/yr. it resonates. when audience sees that it exists, they say they knew they needed that. incentivizes promotion to friends. find things that push emotional buttons. not react vs vue - build pipeline.
- underserved: fill holes in the internet. the 101 guide is done 100x. the 201 guide is not done. tech a+b together. nsqueue + websockets.

friendcatcher list
- stick a fork in it and done guide to broad tightly scoped problem
- calculator which replaces excel spreadsheet. there is almost no calculation too trivial for a program to replace excel. eg ab testing calculator
- definitive curated list of resources. not listicles. josh kaufman personal mba - definitive list of business books.
- cheatsheet. amy hoy ruby on rails cheatsheet.

GET THEIR EMAIL
- not rocket science - put email thing on the bottom of blogpost
- email literally everyone - companies cannot do this at scale. having 100-200 email subs. grind. email individually. I am unreasonably interested in this topic. grind until you get sick of it.

Evertyhin about email courses in one slide
- make a promise with every subject line. keep it.
- 75% education 25% sales. You need both.
- frontload delivery. 3x in first week is fine.
- after end of course, email 1x every 2-4 weeks.

checkpoints you want to reach in your business (you are not out of research phase until...)
- 10 great conversations (25 for saas)
- 500 emails
- 10 commits to buy (in SaaS)

objective external indicia of progress
- 10-40-100 hour work week. can only get 3 things done in a week.
- main dish 50%
- 2 other things 25% each
- everything else is dessert.
- one of those 3 is stuff u dont like but need to do
- one is talking to customers

build the actual thing
- it should be awesome.
- the bar is very low. slightly above where you get sued by people.
- it doesnt have to be the mona lisa

raise your hand if you identify as having impostor syndrome
whole room  raises hands

abuse your advantages
- this is what i do: you are going to be much better than almost all of humanity. builds trust.
- be irrationally responsive to customers esp early
- move fast and make things

charge more
- help you attract the kind of people you want to serve
- whgatever your number is right now, that number is too low.

stripe atlas is great

business advice
- get a new credit account - 1 wk of your life back
- business gmail /google apps account
- accounts@alias
- receipts@alias
- password manager

medium term
- find an accountant
- peer group to talk shop. meet regularly
- derisk your family life
  - retirement savings
  - insurance (term life and long term disability)

dont write blog posts
- blog as 3m words
- blog was a mistake
- blog is a commitment going fwd
- blog is one of the 3 dishes
- dead blog is bad.
- do small valuable things

narrative structures like heroes journey
- works


b2c
- steve jobs 99c - google 0
- answer with a story
- you cant compete with 100b warchest
- dont do horizontal b2c - find a particular grp of cust with emotional resonance about a topic
- prosumers: dnd gamers, semi pro figure skaters.

emailing your customers - talking to people who are saas
- go to 50%

hello ladies
- selling for people who arent themselves developers
- thought that software for devs
- theres not enough software for devs int he world
- number of software devs is increasing 50% a year
- thats fine
- there are large mkts - whoa re underserved
- they may not be best met by you
- its really rough addressing those markets
- women who are profesisonal empoyees at tech businessess
- did a 180 over the years

permaculture talk: https://microconf.gen.co/marie-poulin

- what is your goal
- what do you want to get out of your saas

didn't do enough customer research

1. observe and interact
2. obtain a yield
3. use small and slow solutions
4. apply self regulation and accept feedback

dont build in secret

dont let competitors lead your innovation - learn from your customers. your custs have a lot to teach you.

design from patterns to details
