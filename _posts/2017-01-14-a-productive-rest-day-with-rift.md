I am traveling and sick so today I am taking it easy with freecodecamp and just catching up on reading. I also fixed up some of the look and feel of the blog as I was uncomfortable with leaving it so basic so at least I have some navigation.

I like how some learners have used regular frequency sprints to force themselves to come up with brilliance:

- 180 websites in 180 days by Jen Dewalt <http://blog.jenniferdewalt.com/post/62998082815/after-180-websites-im-ready-to-start-the-rest-of>
- 12 startups in 12 months by the incomparable levels.io <https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/>

I was also amazed to hear from SED (<https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2017/01/12/architecture-of-free-code-camp-with-berkeley-martinez/>) that the CTO of freecodecamp is basically a self-taught node guy with only 3ish years of experience. Not bad for a site that is running [18m visits a month](http://www.rank2traffic.com/freecodecamp.com). I thought it was a little unrealistic that he saw himself running FCC on essentially charity for the long term but I am thankful for it.

In terms of side hustles I have started my first project related to VR: <https://vrplayroom.swyx.io> It is just a simple free instapage for now. I can foresee that the main problem with this project is a localized marketing problem. It is annoying that I cannot hook up stripe or paypal to the base instapage but that is why I learn how to do my own things.
