In this first [12 week year](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CU9P31K/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) of 2018 I summarized 80 popular books. What follows is concentrated life advice for infinite learners.

# Top level

- find your purpose.
- the power of storytelling. Story over argument.
- play to your strengths.
- take risks
- Learning > earning
- set small goals
- Smile
- Internet's impact - Cheap to repeat messages, easy 2 way comps

# Productivity

- Your brain is not a storage device. Put ideas and tasks in a central source of truth, for example a Checklist or a Trello board.
- Discard things that have served their purpose. Say No more often.
- Don't multitask. Multitasking is not Productivity.
- Your willpower is limited.
- Be proactive, take control. 
- Begin with the end in mind; have a Mission, Vision, and specific Goals.
- Put first things first. Urgent != Important; do Urgent & Important things first, then Important Non-urgent things. Avoid Urgent Unimportant things.
- Sharpen the Saw and Recharge. Make sure to balance personal with professional life.
- Make room and Define your working space. Define your work time vs free time. Define your online time vs offline time. Boundaries help you do deep work.

# Psychology

- 40% of actions are unconscious habit. Habits stick because you crave reward. Redirect your cravings, don't resist them.
- Habits are formed through a Trigger -> Action -> Reward -> Investment cycle. Spot companies doing this to you, and use it responsibly.
- Establish Keystone Habits, which help you gain a series of small wins and have positive spillover effects for your willpower and habit formation.
- Beware of System 1 Unconscious flaws (Priming, Halo Effect, Confirmation bias) and System 2 Cognitive flaws (Heuristics, Risk Assessment, Memory).
- Your thinking is being influenced by Priming: Fact recall, Word choice, Credit taking, etc. When making critical decisions, try to take them out of the given context.
- Things go viral if they have Social Currency (makes people look good), Triggers (top of mind), Emotional value, Publicity, Practical Value, or a entertaining/educational Story.
- Ideas are sticky when presented as: Simple, Unexpected, Concrete (with examples or imagery), Credible (backed up with Experts, Stats, or with your audience), Emotional, and having a Story.
- There are 6 weapons of Influence: Reciprocation, Commitment & Consistency, Social Proof, Liking, Authority, and Scarcity.
- There are 4 ways people respond to Outer and Inner expectations. Upholders value self-reliance; just tell them what you need. Questioners value purpose; justify what you want to them. Obligers value teamwork; hold them accountable. Rebels value freedom; let them decide what to do.
- We justify our actions, not vice versa.
- When shit happens, you can reconstruct your reality in a positive way.
- Snap judgments are good at filtering signal from noise and when primed with intelligence and experience. They are bad when rationalizing gut feel, associating competence with looks, under stress, and when unconscious bias is present.
- People have 3 levels of motivation: Basic needs, Extrinsic (eg money, force), Intrinsic. Intrinsic motivation is strongest and is driven by the Flow state, pursuit of meaning, self determination, challenging tasks, and having a voice in decisions.
- Flow is enjoyment of novelty and growth, skillful, immersive, involves challenge and intrinsic reward. Gamify work.

# Being a Manager/CEO/Startup

- Hire based on strength, not absence of weakness. Hire only when necessary. Build flexible teams. Always ask if you have the right people in the right place. Fire fast and fair.
- Having the right People is more important than the right Ideas and Processes.
- Balance strategy vs execution, being a peacetime vs wartime CEO.
- Find and Articulate a simple vision. Make sure this message is delivered, and role model it. Communicate it with a KPI or North Star.
- Motivate people. People work harder when needed and united by a goal. Evaluate performance by team results.
- Decisionmaking: Is this decision worth making? Define who is responsible for the decision, learn from the past, and solicit alternative views.
- Prioritize goals and identify obstacles.
- Avoid Secrecy. Promote open communications/radical truth in relationships and evaluations; use flowcharts and metrics to clarify how things work.
- Try new things and expect to Fail. Fail early and plan iterations. Spend "wasteful" R&D in order to be first to market. Allow personal project days.
- Build momentum.
- Technology is JUST an accelerator. It won't fix what you don't have.
- Promote a culture of discipline.
- Put thought into designing the workplace.
- Level 5 leaders are Excellent managers, Modest, Ambitious, do succession planning, Confront facts, and engage in Socratic Debate.
- How to Cross the Chasm from Visionaries to Pragmatists: Have a Whole Product, establish a Beach-head, make a Powerful Claim, lock down your Distribution Channels, and price like a Market Leader.
- Ask 7 Questions: Is this 10x better? Is this the right time? Can I get a large market share? Do I have the right people? Can I reach the right customers? Can this survive competition? Is this non-consensus?
- B2B > B2C.
- Human-centered Design: Helps users learn to use the product; avoids dangerous errors, and brings users and tech closer together. 
- The power of Word of Mouth means you have to be remarkable or die. Taking risk is SAFER than avoiding risk. Invent with marketing in mind.
- Launch earlier, stand for something, and make it inimitable. Launch early, repeatedly, and authentically.
- Encouraging Focused work is better than long hours.
- Series of quick decisions is better than overplanning.
- Help people manage themselves.
- Start from the problem, not the solution.
- Identify the market's central Pivot; Isolate and create demand around it; Innovate and anticipate second-order effects; Test hypotheses; learn from others' past.
- Do Permission marketing instead of interruption marketing: Appeal to self-interest, focus your efforts on a qualified audience. Your goal is building a relationship, not making a sale. Teach the benefits of your product, and earn trust. This builds long term loyalty and virality.

# Life & Career Philosophy

- Life is too short for complaining or lounging.
- The Days are Long but the Years are Short. The little things you do every day matter more than the big things you try to do once in a while.
- Being right is an illusion: choose values you can control, learn from failure, commit to things and narrow your options.
- Identify and write down your core Principles: fundamental truths to keep you on goal.
- Build up to big goals with low level goals. Balance deliberate vs emergent strategy.
- Choose interesting work.
- Avoid our hidden bias to blame and reward Talent. Effort and Grit is more valuable than Talent; you can go very very far with Deliberate and Intelligent Practice.
- Be in permanent beta and prioritize learning. Learning is more important than Money. Constant learning.
- Know yourself. Know your competitive advantage.
- Pursue breakout opportunities doggedly.
- There are 2 levels of Networking you should pursue: Deep Professional Alliances, and broad, weak acquaintances. Both can be valuable. Relationships need constant work but have a long term payoff.
- Satisfaction = Motivation + Discipline
- Apprentice under a mentor, then outgrow.
- To reach Mastery: Challenge what you have learned. Broaden your mind. Practice skills until they are automatic. Focus on the bigger picture.
- The dominant Medium of our era defines our ideas of truth.
- New tech is always underestimated as extending existing tech.
- Play to your strengths; look for strength in others; deal with coworker frustration by involving their strengths.
- Death is a part of life; live life with meaning while facing death.
- A Growth mindset seeks Development, views Failures as Opportunities, and relish Difficulties. Changing your mindset: Changing role models, reaching out for support, talking about mistakes.
- Play Infinite Games: see a series of moments, endless possibilities, no clear winners, treat it as play, and liberated from the past.
- Grab attention, define a niche, and command loyalty.
- Be fascinated by what you do, stay in flow.
- Eat to Live: >2lbs of greens a day, get 90% of your calories from plants.
- The Resistance opposes all our creative endeavors. Treat your dream like a job and work at it.
- Invoke muses
- Fight hierarchy
- Own a territory.
- Choosing careers: Making a difference, freedom, flow.
- Overcome fear of career change
- Avoid the hedonic treadmill
- Take risks, have clear preferences, build a business. Avoid laziness and arrogance.

# Systems Thinking

- Antifragile systems benefit from volatility, depend on fragile constituents, and overcompensate to stressors.
- Understand stocks vs flows, Positive vs Negative feedback, System resilience, Self organizing systems, and Hierarchical/Fractal systems.
- Mistakes in systems: Managing by only looking at outcomes, doing linear projection and false isolation, having slow/no feedback.
- Look at the 12 Leverage Points in a system: Parameters < Buffer size < Structure < Delay < -ve feedback < +ve feedback < Info flow < Rules < Self Organization < Goals < Mindset < Transcendence.
