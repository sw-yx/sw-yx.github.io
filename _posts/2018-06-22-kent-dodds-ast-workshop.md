because i want to make a babel macro for react-blade i started watching kent dodds' AST workshop yesterday. it is so great. i have tried and tried to learn from the babel handbook and the scant other resources out there but kent's workshop is the first that made it click for me. the visitor pattern and then how to edit arguments in babel itself. finally, how to codemod with babel.
