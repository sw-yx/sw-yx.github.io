i have finished the last part of a-frame school. teleport controllers dont work well in chrome+vive. reported as <https://github.com/fernandojsg/aframe-teleport-controls/issues/14>

I think i can build an interesting tower-defence type of game off of this minecraft demo from kevin ngo: <https://css-tricks.com/minecraft-webvr-html-using-frame/>

AR.js is extremely exciting: <https://jeromeetienne.github.io/AR.js/> it uses aruco markers: <http://docs.opencv.org/trunk/d5/dae/tutorial_aruco_detection.html>. I will check out [this data viz example](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/arplayerforthreejs/blob/master/examples/data-visualization-histogram3d.html) when i have time.

vizor is an interesting alternative to aframe: <http://blog.vizor.io/>

incheon.gg is an interesting backend solution for games <http://incheon.gg/>
