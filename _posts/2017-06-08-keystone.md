I previously blogged about my todo list a few posts back. Now I am working through them.

I spent today messing around with [keystone.js](http://demo.keystonejs.com). this is exactly what i have been seeking with regards to providing a decent admin panel backend to a MERN stack. however the support seems to have died in recent months and that is just an unfortunate fact of open source projects that get abandoned.

I should be able to use keystone if I ever really need it but for now I am focusing on more actively supported frameworks.

Next is guillermo rauch's next.js project.

i also bought wes bos' `learn node` today.
