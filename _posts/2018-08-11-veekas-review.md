starting story - more drama

wtf is reactive programming gif

overwhelming amount of words => yak shaving

explicitly state the structure

(maybe) cut spreadsheets

drop cold vs hot

meh on leaky abstraction

introducing reactive-react <- animation

rective-react core slide

- take out imports
- add boxes
- extra diagram

Counter:

- just like react

crappy bird make it bigger

crazycharts - make gif and replace swizec


push/pull slide - passive / active
- cut to 3 examples


analgoies - rearrange to the core

callback to original story


more animations
