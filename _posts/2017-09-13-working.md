today was more work on the ecommerce project and we started doing more frontend today.

we also did our first REACTO (whiteboard interview practice).

we also did frontend testing (enzyme) today.

i have been tossing the idea of a testing-focused codewars for the capstone project and John (our temp instructor) really liked it.

I also came up with an idea for a generalized auth library which connects the NERDS stack together for people. I think i could write it and maybe publish it to NPM.
