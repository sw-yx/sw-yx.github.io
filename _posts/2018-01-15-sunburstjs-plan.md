we are going to make a persistent clicker app similar to [clementinejs](http://clementinejs.com).

1. introduction to CRA and implementing a basic clientside counter
2. setting up node and express and serving it together with CRA
3. building CRA and deploying
4. adding mongodb/mongoose to express and adding the api route. deploying.

We are done!

But here are more things we can do. lets turn this into a document posting app with different users:
5. adding redux
6. adding passportjs to express; authentication into the app.
7. adding react router including with authentication.
8. adding styling.
9. adding graphql/apollo?
