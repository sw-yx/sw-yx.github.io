I have been really enjoying working out and catching up on old Kalzumeus podcasts and it struck me today that the Personal IPO is a thing. People need to take themselves public in all sorts of fields and it is hard. So it could be easier.

In particular Nathan Barry says to [Teach Everything You Know](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/06/how-to-launch-anything/). It is so simple it is easy to brush off. but it is true.

I am also very interested in building what I used to call "prodesign30" but now I am leaning closer to The Swyx Center For Kids Who Can't Design Good And Wanna Learn To Design Other Stuff Good Too just for the hilarity of it. It is basically a training-wheels course for myself and anyone who wants to follow along in making designs just a _little_ bit better than default bootstrap. And it should probably always be on codepen.

The other thing Nathan advocates strongly is to build a mailing list. I haven't at all been serious about this (going so far as to put up a short lived newsletter on free wordpress which sucked) but I can see how it is important. 

I am working through classes on hackdesign.org but it is clearly far too design oriented. Lesson 2 is a whole thing on typography. lesson 3 or 4 is on photoshop. screw that.

We need incrementally better design now.

What I am going to do today:
- decouple this devblog (low effort) from my domain
- put my domain on DO
- host some sort of CMS but with the ability to set up new routes for other projects (including my own clone of buffer)
- put up a landing page on codepen.

well i got the DO hosting done and didnt use a CMS but ended up using a free HTML5 template that looked nice enough. it is probably not worth me putting more time into this for now. I should build prodesign30 instead.
