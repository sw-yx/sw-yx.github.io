soo much bs for this assignment haha. here are my lecture notes for human abilities lecture

- What Humans Can Do
  - Input: how stimuli are sent from the world, perceived inside the mind
  - Processing: how it stores and processes the input it has received
  - Output: how it controls indivudal's actions
- Information Processing (processor view of human)
  - Visual: color, movement in center. motion: periphery. consider color blindness, adjustable font size.
  - Auditory: pitch, loudness, localizing sound. useful for alerts, problematic for oversharing info
  - Haptic: more personal feedback - feels keys go down
- Cognition (memory)
  - Perceptual store (working memory)
    - Visuospatial sketchpad
    - Phonological loop
    - episodic buffer (integrating info from other system, chron ordering. expertise increases this buffer eg chess example)
    - Central executive
  - Short term memory
    - Chunking: about 4-5 chunks of info (no longer 7 +/- 2)
    - Recognition: recognize is better than recall
    - Only ask user to hold 4-5 chunks. Use recognition over recall
  - Long term memory
    - seemingly unlimited
    - but hard to load. have to put into short term memory a few times
  - Learning
    - Procedural: how to do something <- what we do in hci, unconsciously competent
    - Declarative: Knowledge about something <- how we communicate about what we are doing
  - Cognitive load
    - things that compete for cognitive resources include stress and focusing on many things art once
    - to reduce load:
      - use multiple modalities: eg visual + verbal
      - let modalities complement each other: support instead of compete
      - give user control of the pace
      - emphasize central content - minimize clutter
      - offload tasks - look closely at what the user has to do or remember - ask tif they can offload tasks
  - Motor system
    - spotify control widget lock screen vs swipe screen. x button too close to the skip button.  full context is impt. how precise they have to be, reduce the penalty for errors
