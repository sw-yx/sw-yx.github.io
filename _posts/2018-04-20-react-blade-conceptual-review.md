today i had a good chat with N. G. sketching out what i've done so far for react blade. he raised some good points:

- name conflicts with `.map()` and .`query()`
- potentially having a "graphql renderer" that takes jsx and renders a graphql powered wrapper around it (i.e. doesnt use suspense at all)

all good points.
