I am running into a major brick wall today. I have a working Episode add/edit flow, but when it comes to doing the exact same thing for Summaries, the fields I want to display don't display. I am setting the defaultValue correctly and I have ruled out all possible causes of this problem.

I dont know what is causing this.
