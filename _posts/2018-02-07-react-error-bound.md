continuing prior work from https://github.com/sw-yx/sw-yx.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2018-02-05-react-catch-error-prelim-work.md

first i need to deconstruct react-error-overlay.

then i should check out react dev utils:
- <https://github.com/reactjs-academy/react-dev-utils-academy>
- <https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dev-utils>

and other react issues:
