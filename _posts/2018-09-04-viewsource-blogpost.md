I am back in singapore and reenergized after a super hectic week last week (SF trip and then graphqlnyc talk and moving out).

Yesterday was labor day and i spent it reconnecting with family.

Today I started a blogpost with this:

For many, Javascript build tooling is both [a Pandora's Box](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo/status/1021461165518479360) and [a Faustian bargain](https://christianheilmann.com/2018/07/09/different-views-on-view-source/): It has enabled us to build wonderfully complex, yet maintainable apps not possible 10 years ago, but at the same time Javascript bundles are well past the point of human readability.

but then i stopped because i think i was scoping the blogpost too far when really i was just demoing a very simple capability. so i am throwing it out.
