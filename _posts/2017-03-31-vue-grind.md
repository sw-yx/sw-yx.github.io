maybe it is a factor of the environment (i am in the office and it is exceedingly warm) but it was a slog getting through two sections of the vue course today. we covered components and it seems there is exactly the same finnickiness as react when dealing with parent and child components. however there is one saving grace which is custom event (and [the event bus design pattern](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html#Non-Parent-Child-Communication)) : <https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html#Custom-Events>
