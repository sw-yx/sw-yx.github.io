i am having a TON of fun even though I am unemployed.

so many little nuggets of interestingness today, none major:

- DockerNYC - <https://www.meetup.com/Docker-NewYorkCity/events/243339801/> I saw one of the best developer advocate talks I have ever seen from [Stefana Muller](https://opsani.com/dockermeetup). She told an engaging story, created a need, and then filled the need with her product. THAT is how to sell. Then the other presentation was on deploying a [MERN app to EC2 using Docker](https://github.com/cefjoeii/mern-crud) and [Coldbrew](https://github.com/coldbrewcloud/coldbrew-cli) and that is basically what I really really need to learn right now. Extremely useful evening. DockerNYC was also super well organized in general.
- got a very fascinating opportunity from [Ryan Glover](http://www.ryanglover.net/) (more on thursday) - <http://www.ryanglover.net/articles/exploration/>
- had a fun time at Moat looking at ad time measurement
- talked about sudoku solving looking at it as an exact cover problem [using dancing links](http://buzzard.ups.edu/talks/beezer-2010-stellenbosch-sudoku.pdf) - js explanation <https://stackoverflow.com/a/10507481/1106414> (More: <https://sudokugarden.de/en/solve/dancing-links>)
- couple conversations with 2sig and pdt

i am meeting a couple old coworkers tomorrow and the day after and they each have project ideas.

product hunt is also interesting but the parameters are too broad.
