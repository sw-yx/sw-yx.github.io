4 hour coding test today. these issues were helpful: 

- <https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/581>
- <https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/2205>

i think i went overbaord with the react scaffolding but i made my choice. i also struggled adapting data to `react-chartist`.

i also edited another IS episode today.

slow grind.
