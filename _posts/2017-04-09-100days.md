tomorrow marks the 100th day of 2017. looking back at what I have done over the last 100 days, I went from figuring out clementine.js to learning React to building my VR-ready PC to learning Meteor to falling sick to having a zero week to completing FCC to learning Vue. Its a lot but at the same time doesn't feel like a lot. I do want to migrate to a better CMS and so this week is going to be wordpress week.
