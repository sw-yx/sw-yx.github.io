my impostor syndrome is hitting hard.

been interviewing with some seriously accomplished people recently and i really struggle to understand why i am worth talking to and/or how to add value to them. i am so focused on adding value to other people, while they just want me to be me and i almost dont know how to do that.

Culture change with design

- share the UX: designer is not the only owner of design
- stay honest (be ruthless)
- Research as a team sport: avoid "useless, expense, fear" objections
- Play in the same field / Design WITH code / avoid hidden waterfalls
- share and celebrate (sticker patches!)

design principles

- start with needs
- do less
- design with data
- do the hard work to make it simple
- iterate then iterate again
- this is for everyone
- understand context
- build digital services not websites
- be consistent not uniform
- make things open: it makes things better

i think designing for incrementality is an important idea - we dont want to encourage incremental thinking but we must accommodate incremental needs. it is impossible to expect a rebuild everytime a small thing changes. but how do you design for incrementality?
