Culture change with design

- share the UX: designer is not the only owner of design
- stay honest (be ruthless)
- Research as a team sport: avoid "useless, expense, fear" objections
- Play in the same field / Design WITH code / avoid hidden waterfalls
- share and celebrate

design principles

- start with needs
- do less
- design with data
- do the hard work to make it simple
- iterate then iterate again
- this is for everyone
- understand context
- build digital services not websites
- be consistent not uniform
- make things open: it makes things better
