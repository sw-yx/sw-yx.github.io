i have just viewed [cs50 lecture 0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAs4VyEN-SM) and it was disappointing because it was too basic. i am moderating my own views right now and going for react on codepen as it at least lets me learn something. i will still have to cover my bases somewhere but cs50 is probably not it right now.

back to react.

i got pretty far today. finished the react module and started on reducers in redux before deciding I knew enough to fill out the markdown previewer in FCC. there is some trickiness in codepen with regards ES6 syntax (codepen doesnt seem to support fat pipe function declaration eg `functionname() => { etc}` preferring `functionname:function(){ etc }` and for class creation same thing `var App = React.createClass({` instead of `const App = () => {`

i think i need to get natively productive in react wich means rebuilding the markdown previewer by myself tomorrow given what i learned today about the codepen limitations for the es6 syntax
