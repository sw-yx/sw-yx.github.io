today was slightly better than yesterday. we did react-redux which uses HOCs and i think some people get lost while others like myself kinda get it but need some guidance for now. i wonder if its worth memorizing this thing.

we had a talk about what senior phase is going to look like and i am excited to work with the new instructors.

dinner with Danny was nice.

i still feel like i am running in circles.
