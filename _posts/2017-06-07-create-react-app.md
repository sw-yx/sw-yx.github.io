i have basically finished [my little flirtation with contributing to an open source boilerplate](https://github.com/icebob/vue-express-mongo-boilerplate/issues/48#issuecomment-306810835). At the end of the day it is awe inspiring to learn directly from an obviously insanely capable full stack developer, but the whole thing feels a little too fringe and I need to work on my core skills instead of copying and pasting programming patterns.

today i am working on [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#integrating-with-an-api-backend), which I tried out before during FCC but never really tried once I discovered that there was difficulty adding a Node backend (CRA's docs itself redirects you to [the dated fullstackreact site](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#node)) and react router. I am also hoping to learn firebase so I maybe dont have to even use a node backend.
