----

1. reviewed https://www.notion.so/netlify/JAMstack-org-Meeting-6-7-d92fe905d0d146f6b9d8dc0d3bab991f
2. chris: have part of the site explicitly owned by not-netlify community members (e.g. ecomm).
3. sarah: office hours for jamstack meetup
4. perry: people PR in their sites as JAMstack examples, nobody really reviewing - want to engage, teach, enable them
5. chris: potential for JAMstack to be a -VEEERY- large resource. like what if JAMstack were a foundation.
6. sarah: want to put what people repeatedly want to know up top e.g. benefits
7. lauren: is it a community? do we have a mission? origin stories/historical context
8.
