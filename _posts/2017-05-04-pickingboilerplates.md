##vue boilerplate day!

i spent a lot of time yesterday on <https://github.com/icebob/vue-express-mongo-boilerplate>. It is a very solid walled webapp but still has a lot of holes. icebob is clearly a very good designer and he went for that first without necessarily having the code to back up the design, for example in notifications. I think there is a solid chance i might adopt and even contribute to this project. discussion here: <https://github.com/icebob/vue-express-mongo-boilerplate/issues/42>

I looked at <https://github.com/patrickbolle/vuejs-boilerplate/issues/9> but was not familiar with their two-folder structure.

[MillerRen](https://github.com/MillerRen/vue-boilerplate) comes with a nice deployed site <http://renyufei.com/vue-boilerplate/> but there is no backend at all. this one doesnt even come deployed <https://github.com/petervmeijgaard/vue-2.0-boilerplate>.

I wrote up my furstrations here: <https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/69aw8s/i_have_a_probably_dumb_idea_please_tell_me_why_it/>
