it is monday and i am feeling productive. I have a boilerplate search project that i have been thinking about for a while and i came across something similar today. I decided to note down a few resources I will use to seed my project in future.

for my `blink` project today i will try this vue + firebase tutorial: <https://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/vue-js-2-firebase-e4b2479e35a8>

---

it went ok except i had a minor stumble with regards to how `this` is binded in es5 vs es6 functions. obscure.

next, to deploy, i am using this: <https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/quickstart>

deployment went well and was intuitive. now i have to figure out how to bring the table [over from codepen](https://codepen.io/swyx/pen/pwbyqb)
