today i worked on CI/CD: integrating Travis/Codeship/CodeClimate for the JEFS graceshopper project. was interesting. value of it is not immediate but its good to familiarize with these tools now.

i also tried deeplearn.js but lacked any ideas for using it

i also tried to do a tutorial on nodemailer but that idea died pretty quickly when i saw how many other tutorials existed on it.

wes bos' tips on productivity were pretty handy. i am using rocket ðŸš€ and clipy from now on.
