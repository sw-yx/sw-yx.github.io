description: planning out my 12 week year
---

new year, new 12 week year. i want to get down to business but my commitments in sg are making it hard. i am also staying til devfest asia and hopefully no more than that although i am facing a lot of grief with the https://cgifederal.secure.force.com site right now.

i am very determined to make the most out of what life i have been given.

1. 80% vegetarian / exercise daily
2. finish coursera ML and fast.ai v2 (http://forums.fast.ai/t/welcome-to-part-1-v2/5787)
3. set up react review
4. revamp swyx.io to incorporate my shares and start capturing emails
5. knock out firepup
6. blinkist every day


thats it. i cant do too much. i have a natural bias toward quantity but i need to force myself towards quality.
