i am developing on graphiql and there are a host of associated problems. tidbits:

- tried using vue, abandoned because graphiql is a React component
- tried using Nextjs, abandoned because graphiql cannot be SSR'ed easily
- tried using CRA, abandoned because node server ux is shit
- i filed some issues such as <https://github.com/graphql/graphql-language-service/issues/179>

Still, i have a basic mvp up. <https://github.com/sw-yx/FSA-GraphQL-of-Thrones> now i need to map out a user flow and that is all redux

Resources i am using:
