Today is Independence day.

This blog is intentionally not easy to find for people who are not determined. It is also hard to read because it is basically me talking to myself and I do that faster than I type.

So if you are reading this, I'm a little curious why, but I will indulge you on condition that you tell me everything I am doing wrong.

I have been on a streak of personal philosophy discoveries recently. To wit:

- Taking yourself public is important. This is accomplished through: teaching, writing, and most recently speaking. This is difficult when there is no coherent message or mission.
- Agents have no Agency. So being an agent (employee) is a safety net but also a shackle.
- Smart people don't do simple things but they should.
- A personal network must be groomed and does not just happen (for me).
- Business opportunities take faith and energy and the proof points should be balanced versus the investment.

I think the Personal IPO is the most important one of the lot. And the journey starts with publishing a [not so secret](https://www.tesla.com/blog/secret-tesla-motors-master-plan-just-between-you-and-me) master plan. Just between you and me.

The Plan:

- Create a following through a number of ventures, one of which may payoff. The list: Move 'Zig', Impostor Syndrome, GetGist, HOHN, DualClassMe, ProDesign30.
- Use what I learn to write a book. Either the Personal IPO or something technical.
- Use the book to expand network and discover real problems.
- Use network to validate and solve a real problem.
- Don't tell anyone.
