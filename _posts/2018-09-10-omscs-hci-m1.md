## Direct Manipulation

- UI disappears - invisible interfaces is the ultimate goal
- desktop metaphor - moving files and folders
- Direct Manipulation of Interfaces paper
  - Distance: feeling of directness is inversely proportional to the amount of cognitive effort it takes to manipulate and evlauate a system
    - semantic distance - how hard is it to know what to do 
    - articulatory distance - how hard it is to actually do the thing 
    - both span gulf of execution and evluation - see circle diagram
  - Direct engagement - give the feeling that one is directly in control of the object of our goals and intentions
- making indirect manipulation direct - use animation to mimic the action - so design interfaces that mimic the interactions that feel more direct
- invisibility by learning happens - but constrained by time taken by users to learn it
- when you do it right - people wont be aware you've done anything at all
- 5 tips:
  - use affordances - visual design to suggest how it should be used - dials for turning
  - know your user
  - differentiate your user - beginner vs expert - multiple ways to do a task eg copy buton vs ctrl c 
  - let your interface teach - show the hotkey next to the funciton
  - talk to your user - ask what they're thinking
- up/down in video games - portal 2 learning up/down without settings

## Human Abilities

- Input, processing, output

(skipped for now)

## Design Principles

- Four sets of dseign principles
  - Don Norman 6 principles
  - Ten design heuristics
  - Software for use
  - Seven principles of universal design (accessibility)
- Discoverability
  - make options visible? - deliver instructions in context or in a log
- Simplicity
  - no extra info (nielsen)
  - make common tasks easy, using user's own language, providing good shortcuts (lockwood)
  - regardless of xp, knowledge, language skills (mace)
- Affordances
  - design + simple = by their very design it tells you how to use them
  - button hover style crease a raise to indicate it is clickable
  - visualize the space of options in a color picker
  - signifiers are in context instructions like arrow or menu buttons consistent with others
  - vocabulary: affordance vs perceived affordance vs signifier
- Mapping
  - strong mappings help info appear in logical natural order
  - eg mapping of display on monitors
- Perceptibility
  - feedback within reasonable time
  - light switch up down vs fan chain
- Consistency
  - lessons learned in systems are transferable, follow platform conventions. reuse components and behaviors.
  - they may sometimes conflict (ctrl Y)
- Feedback
  - accelerators (hotkeys) - users tailor frequent actions
  - design accomodates wide range of individual prefs and abilities
  - Nielsen: plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, constructively suggest a solution
  - Norman: Feedback must be immediate, informative
  - Constantine: Keep users informed of actions, changes of state, and errors, through clear, concise, unambiguous language
- Equity
  - appears to clash with flexibility
  - same experience but flexible?
- Ease and Comfort
  - appropriate size and space for manipulation regardless of posture or mobility
  - can be used efficiently with a minimum fatigue
- Structure
  - organize in meaningful ways - help mental model map to task
- Constraints
  - no such thing as user error!
  - constrain users to only perform actions in the first place
  - careful design prevents problem from occurring in the first place. use confirmation?
  - norman 4 constraints
    - physical - eg 3 prong plug
    - cultural - eg forming a line while waiting
    - semantic - eg rearview mirror
    - logical - self evident based on situation eg assembling furntiture and putting screws in holes
  - being more visible rather than invisible in order to help. 
- Tolerance
  - undo and redo - recoverability
  - minimize adverse consequences
  - a computer shall not harm your work, or through inactivity, allow your work to come to harm
- Flexibility
- Documentation
  - may be necessary to provide help and documentation
  - better: framed in terms of tasks  instead of listing out entire api
- other sets of principles
  - pereptibility, tolerance and feedback have some variances to take note of
  - conceptual models is norman's 7th principle
  - hci
    - learniability
    - flexibility
    - robustness
  - reducing cog load
  - humane interface
  - computer graphics p

# Needfinding and Requirements Gather

- try to avoid preconceived notions
  - defining questions about user
  - generating answers about user
  - formalizing methods about users
- Data Inventory
  - who are the users?
  - where are the users?
  - what is the context of the task?
  - what are their goals?
  - right now, what do they need?
  - what are their tasks?
  - what are their subtasks?
- Problem Space
  - not just the interface itself, but also the entire context in which it is being used (eg holding babyu)
- User Types
  - Kids vs Adults
  - Experts vs Novices
- 5 Bias in needfinding
  - Confirmation bias - look for being wrong, testing empirically, involving multiple observers
  - observer bias - scripting your interactions with users and having someone else review yoru survey for leading questions
  - social desirability bias - hide what the social response is, more naturalistic observations
  - voluntary response bias - oversampling more extreme views - confirm conclusions with other methods
  - recall bias - people dont recall what they did or how they felt - conducting interviews during activity
- naturalistic observation
  - take notes
  - start specific and then abstract
  - spread out your sessions
  - find a partner, compare notes
  - look for questions
- participant observation
  - you are not your user
- hacks and workarounds
  - look at hacks users currently use
  - eg post it notes on computer with 6 screens. why dont they use the existing apps?
- errors
  - errors - where nothing wrong with mental model, they just made a problem
  - mistakes - where mental model is weak
  - hacks and errors are conscious - can just interview them
  - apprenticeship approach - train to become users
- ethnography and apprenticeship
  - train under them, video recording themselves
- interviews
  - 6 w's: who what when where how - avoid yes/no qtns that can go to a survey
  - be aware of bias - including smiling when they agree with you
  - listen - dont have a conversation
  - organize the interview
  - practice
- think aloud
  - think out loud while doing the thing - different from interviews
  - avoid forgetting while no longer in the task
  - but is more cognitive
  - post event protocol is better?
- surveys
  - broader data
  - 5 tips
    - less is more
    - be aware of bias, phrasing
    - tie them to inventory
    - test it out
    - iterate
- good survey qtns
  - clear - assign words to number scales. timebox frequency
  - concise - plain language pls
  - specific - dont ask questions on big ideas, or double barrel qtn.
  - expressive - give levels of frequency or agreement, allow multiple qtns, add nominal categories
  - unbiased - leave potentially open ended qtns open, dont lead or load qtns
  - usable - progress bar, page lengths consistent, order your questions logically
- other data gathering
  - data logs
- iterative needfinding: interaction between the few different methods
- revisit the initial questions up top
- represent the need - step by step of the tasks - at operator level or a network or strugtural diagram to get data back. to get to flowchart of decision making points
